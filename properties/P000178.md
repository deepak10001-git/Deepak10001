A family $\mathcal{P}$ of subsets of $X$ is called a $k$-network if for any compact set $K \subseteq X$ and open set $U \subseteq X$ with $K \subseteq U$, there exists a finite $\mathcal{P}^* \subseteq \mathcal{P}$ with $K \subseteq \bigcup \mathcal{P}^* \subseteq U$. A family of subsets of $X$ is called $\sigma$-locally finite if it is a countable union of locally finite families. $X$ is called an $\aleph$-space if it is $T_3$ and has a $\sigma$-locally finite $k$-network.
