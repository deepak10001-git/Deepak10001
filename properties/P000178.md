A space that is {P5} and has a $\sigma$-locally finite $k$-network.  Here, a family $\mathcal{P}$ of subsets of $X$ is called a *$k$-network* if for every compact set $K$ and open set $U$ in $X$ with $K \subseteq U$, there exists a finite $\mathcal{P}^* \subseteq \mathcal{P}$ with $K \subseteq \bigcup \mathcal{P}^* \subseteq U$.  And the family $\mathcal P$ is *$\sigma$-locally finite* if it is a countable union of locally finite families.
