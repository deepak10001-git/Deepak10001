Linearly ordered topological space (LOTS): a space whose topology can be induced by a total order on the underlying set.

If $X$ is a set and $<$ is a total order on $X$ then the order topology on $(X,<)$ is generated by the base consisting of open intervals $(a,b) = \{x\in X\mid a < x < b\}$ and open rays $(a,\infty) = \{x\in X \mid a < x\}$ and $(-\infty, a) = \{x\in X\mid x < a\}$. Here, $\infty$ and $-\infty$ are merely formal symbols and not points of $X$.
