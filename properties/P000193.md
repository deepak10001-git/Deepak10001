A space in which every open cover admits a shrinking; that is, a space $X$ in which, given any open cover $\mathscr U$, there is a function $s : \mathscr U \to \tau_X \setminus \{\emptyset\}$ such that $s[\mathscr U]$ is an open cover and, for each $U \in \mathscr U$, $\mathrm{cl}_X s(U) \subseteq U$.
