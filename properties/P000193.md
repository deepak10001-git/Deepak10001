A space that is {P16}, {P3}, and {P47}.

Equivalently, a space that is {P16} and {P48}; {P16}, {P1}, and {P50}; or {P75} and {P2}.

Also known as profinite spaces, referring to the fact that such spaces are precisely the cofiltered limits of finite discrete spaces. See the section on [Profinite spaces](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/08ZW) at the Stacks project.
