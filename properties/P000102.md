A space $X$ for which
there is a distance function (or "semimetric") $d:X^2\to[0,\infty)$
satisfying reflexivity ($d(x,y)=0\Leftrightarrow x=y$) and symmetry
($d(x,y)=d(y,x)$), such that the neighborhood balls
$B(x,\varepsilon)=\{y\in X:d(x,y)<\varepsilon\}$ for $\varepsilon>0$
form a neighborhood basis at each point $x\in X$.
(Note that {{zb:0116.14303}} demonstrates that
these neighborhoods need not be open sets.)

Equivalently:
- there exists a semimetric $d$ such that $p$ lies in the closure of some $Y\subseteq X$ iff $\inf\{d(y,p):y\in Y\}=0$.
- The space is {P28} witnessed by $\{G_n(x):n<\omega\}$
  for each $x\in X$, and if $y\in X$ belongs to $G_n(x_n)$ for some sequence
  $x_n$, then $x_n\to y$.

Defined in e.g. {{zb:0113.16501}} and {{doi:10.2991/978-94-6239-216-8}}
