A space $X$ for which
there is a distance function (or "semi-metric") $d:X^2\to[0,\infty)$
satisfying reflexivity ($d(x,y)=0\Leftrightarrow x=y$) and symmetry
($d(x,y)=d(y,x)$), such that if $p$ is
a limit point of some $Y\subseteq X$, then $\inf\{d(y,p):y\in Y\}=0$.

Defined in e.g. {{zb:0116.14303}}, where the following equivalence was
given: the space is {P28} witnessed by $\{G_n(x):n<\omgea\}$
for each $x\in X$, and if $y\in X$ belongs to $G_n(x_n)$ for some sequence
$x_n$, then $x_n\to y$.
