A space with a $\sigma$-locally finite network.

A family $\mathcal N$ of subsets of $X$ is called a *network* if every open set is the union of a subfamily of $\mathcal N$; that is, for every open set $U$ and point $x\in U$ there is some $A\in\mathcal N$ with $x\in A\subseteq U$.  The family $\mathcal N$ is *$\sigma$-locally finite* if it is a countable union of locally finite families.

See for example page 127 of {{zb:0684.54001}}.
