There exists a generic point $p \in X$. 

$p \in X$ is a *generic point* if $\{p\}$ is dense in $X$.

Equivalently, $X$ is the only closed set containing $p$.

Equivalently, $p$ is an element of every nonempty open subset of $X$.

Equivalently, $p$ is a generalization of every point of $X$, according to the specialization preorder. See {{wikipedia:Specialization_(pre)order}}.
