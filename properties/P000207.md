For each neighborhood $U$ of the diagonal $\Delta=\{(x,x)\mid x\in X\}$
in $X\times X$, there is a neighborhood $V$ of the diagonal such that
$V\circ V\subseteq U$.

Studied by Cohen in {{zb:0046.16403}}
(<http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3186w/f290.image>),
where it was shown to be
strictly stronger than {P88}.
