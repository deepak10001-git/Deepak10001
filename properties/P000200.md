$X$ has trivial homotopy groups up to degree $1$. See [n-connected space in nLab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/n-connected+space).

Equivalently, every pair of points in $X$ is connected by a unique homotopy class of paths. See Proposition 1.6. of {{zb:1044.55001}}.

Equivalently, $X$ is {P37} and every continuous map $S^1 \to X$ extends to a continuous map $D^2 \to X$. 

Equivalently, $X$ is {P37} and every continuous map $S^1 \to X$ is homotopic to a constant map.
