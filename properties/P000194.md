A space in which every open cover has a $\theta$-sequence of open refinements; that is, a space in which, for every open cover $\mathscr U$, there exists a sequence $\langle \mathscr V_n : n \in \omega\rangle$ of open covers where each $\mathscr V_n$ is a refinement of $\mathscr U$ and, for each point $x$ of the space, there exists $n \in \omega$ such that $\mathscr V_n$ is point-finite at $x$.
