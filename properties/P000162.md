A space that is homeomorphic to a closed subset of a (not necessarily finite) power of {S25}.

Equivalently (see {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4615-7819-2}}), every real $z$-ultrafilter $\mathcal U$ on the space $X$ is fixed,
i.e., we can find $x\in X$ such that $\mathcal U=\{Z\in Z(X):x\in Z\}$.
Here, $Z(X)$ is the collection of all zero sets of X, a $z$-ultrafilter is an ultrafilter on the lattice $Z(X)$, and
it is real when it is closed under countable intersections.
