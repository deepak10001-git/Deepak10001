A space which is the union of an increasing sequence of {P3} {P16} subsets
$K_1\subseteq K_2 \subseteq K_3 \subseteq \cdots$ such that a set is closed (resp. open) whenever
its intersection with each $K_n$ is closed (resp. open) in the subspace topology.

Defined in {{zb:0416.54027}}. The corresponding notion without {P3} is
{P98}. See also {P140}, {P141},
and {P142}.
