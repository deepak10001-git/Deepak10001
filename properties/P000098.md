A space which is the union of an increasing sequence of compact subsets
$K_1\subseteq K_2 \subseteq K_3 \subseteq \cdots$ such that a set is closed (resp. open) if and only
if its intersection with each $K_n$ is closed (resp. open) in the subspace topology.

Defined in {{mr:0540599}} with the assumption each $K_n$ is Hausdorff; we do not make this assumption
for better compatibility with other properties.
