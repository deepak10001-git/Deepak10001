A space whose topology coincides with the final topology with respect the family of all continuous maps from arbitrary compact Hausdorff spaces.  A subset $A\subseteq X$ is open (resp. closed) iff $f^{-1}(A)$ is open (resp. closed) in $K$ for every compact Hausdorff space $K$ and every continuous map $f:K\to X$.
