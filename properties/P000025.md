A space that is {P17} and {P23}.
Equivalently, $X=\bigcup_{n<\omega}K_n$ where for each $x\in X$, there exists
$n<\omega$ such that $K_n$ is a compact neighborhood of $x$. Also equivalently,
$X=\bigcup_{n<\omega}K_n$ for which $K_n\subseteq int(K_{n+1})$.

Defined on page 21 of {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}} as "$\sigma$-Locally Compact".
