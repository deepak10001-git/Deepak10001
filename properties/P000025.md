A space that is [$\\sigma$-compact](/properties/P000017.md) and [weakly locally compact](/properties/P000023.md).
Equivalently, $X=\\bigcup_{n<\\omega}K_n$ where for each $x\\in X$, there exists
$n<\\omega$ such that $K_n$ is a compact neighborhood of $x$.

Defined on page 21 of {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}} as "$\\sigma$-Locally Compact".
