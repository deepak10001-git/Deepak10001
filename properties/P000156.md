The space satisfies the selection principle $\mathsf S_1(\mathcal K,\mathcal K)$: for every sequence $\langle \mathscr U_n : n \in \omega \rangle$ of $k$-covers of $X$, there exist choices $U_n \in \mathscr U_n$ so that $\{ U_n :n \in \omega \}$ is an $k$-cover of $X$.
(A family $\mathcal U$ of open subsets of $X$ is called a *$k$-cover* if each compact subset of $X$ is contained in an element of $\mathcal U$ and $X \notin \mathcal U$.)
