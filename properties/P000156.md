A family $\mathcal U$ of open subsets of a topological space $X$ is called a $k$-cover if every compact subset of $X$ is contained in one of the members and $X \not\in \mathcal U$.

A space is $k$-Rothberger if it satisfies the selection principle $\mathsf S_1(\mathcal K,\mathcal K)$: for every sequence $\langle \mathscr U_n : n \in \omega \rangle$ of $k$-covers of $X$, there exist choices $U_n \in \mathscr U_n$ so that $\{ U_n :n \in \omega \}$ is an $k$-cover of $X$.
