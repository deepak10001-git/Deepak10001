Every non-{P137} {P39} closed subspace of $X$ is
{P201}.

Equivalently, the Kolmogorov quotient of the space is {P73}. (See {T512}.)

See for example Definition 5.8.6 in the section on [Irreducible components](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/004U) from the Stacks project, or the paragraph after Definition 1.2 in {{doi:10.35834/mjms/1316032836}}.
