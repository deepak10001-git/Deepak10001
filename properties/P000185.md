Any of the following equivalent properties holds:

- There exists a basis for the topology that is also a partition into disjoint sets.
- Every open set is closed.
- Every closed set is open.
- The space's Kolmogorov quotient is {P52}.
- The space is the disjoint union of a collection of {P129} spaces.

For further characterizations, see theorem 25 of https://www.acadsci.fi/mathematica/Vol03/vol03pp185-205.pdf.
