Markov Menger: The second player has a Markov winning strategy in the Menger game (relying on only the round number and most recent move of the opponent). See Game 1.5 and Definition 2.2 of {{doi:10.14712/1213-7243.2015.201}} for more details.

Markov $\Omega$-Menger: The second player has a Markov winning strategy in the game $\mathsf{G}_{\mathrm{fin}}(\Omega_X,\Omega_X)$ (relying on only the round number and most recent move of the opponent). See pages 2 and 3 of {{doi:10.1016/j.topol.2019.07.008}} for more details.

The equivalence of Markov Menger with Markov $\Omega$-Menger is established in {{mathse:4730419}}.
