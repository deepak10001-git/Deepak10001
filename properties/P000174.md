Each point of the space has a neighborhood base well-ordered by reverse inclusion.

Equivalently, each point of the space has a neighborhood base totally ordered by reverse inclusion.  The two are equivalent since a linear order admits a well-ordered cofinal subset.

Such spaces are called *well-based* in {{doi:10.1016/j.topol.2014.08.002}} and *lob-spaces* (lob = "linearly ordered (local) base") in {{mr:0540476}}.
