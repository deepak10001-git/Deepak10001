A space such that given any two topologically distinguishable points each has a neighborhood not including the other point.  (Two points are topologically distinguishable if there is an open set containing one of the points and not the other.)  Equivalently, a space whose Kolmogorov quotient is $T_1$.

Defined in {{wikipedia:T1_space}}, which also lists many equivalent characterizations.  Also in definition 16.6, p. 438 of {{mr:1417259}} as "symmetric space".  The $R_0$ terminology seems preferable to avoid confusion with symmetric spaces from Riemannian geometry.
