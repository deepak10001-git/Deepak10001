For every discrete family $(F_i)_{i \in I}$  of closed subsets of $X$ there exists a pairwise disjoint family of open sets $(U_i)_{i \in I}$, such that $F_i \subseteq U_i$.
Here, a discrete family is a family of subsets such that each point of $X$ has a neighborhood meeting at most one of the subsets.

Equivalently, for every discrete family $(F_i)_{i \in I}$  of closed subsets of $X$ there exists a discrete family of open sets $(U_i)_{i \in I}$, such that $F_i \subseteq U_i$.  The equivalence between the two definitions is Theorem 5.1.17 of {{zb:0684.54001}}.

Defined on page 168 of {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}}.
