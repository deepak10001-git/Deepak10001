A space that is {P5} and has a countable $k$-network.  Here, a family $\mathcal{P}$ of subsets of $X$ is called a *$k$-network* if for every compact set $K$ and open set $U$ in $X$ with $K \subseteq U$, there exists a finite $\mathcal{P}^* \subseteq \mathcal{P}$ with $K \subseteq \bigcup \mathcal{P}^* \subseteq U$.

Equivalently, a space that is {P5} and has a countable pseudobase.  Here, a family $\mathcal{P}$ of subsets of $X$ is called a *pseudobase* if for every compact set $K$ and open set $U$ in $X$ with $K \subseteq U$, there exists some $P\in\mathcal{P}$ with $K \subseteq P \subseteq U$.

For the equivalence between the two, note that every pseudobase is a $k$-network.  And conversely given a countable $k$-network $\mathcal P$, the collection of finite unions of elements of $\mathcal P$ is a countable pseudobase.
