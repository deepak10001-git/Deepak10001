The space satisfies the selection principle $\mathsf S_{\mathrm{fin}}(\Omega,\Omega)$: for every sequence $\langle \mathscr U_n : n \in \omega \rangle$ of $\omega$-covers of $X$, there exist choices $\mathcal F_n$, a finite subset of $\mathscr U_n$, so that $\bigcup_{n\in\omega} \mathcal F_n$ is an $\omega$-cover of $X$.
(A family $\mathcal U$ of open subsets of $X$ is called an *$\omega$-cover* if each finite subset of $X$ is contained in an element of $\mathcal U$ and $X \notin \mathcal U$.)

Equivalently, every finite power of $X$ is {P66}.

See {{doi:10.1016/S0166-8641(96)00075-2}}; the equivalence with every finite power being {P66} is Theorem 3.9.
