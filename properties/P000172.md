A space such that for each $A\subseteq X$ and each $p\in \overline A$ there is a transfinite sequence $(x_\alpha)_{\alpha<\lambda}$ of points of $A$ converging to $p$.  (Here $\lambda$ is a limit ordinal and can always be taken to be a regular cardinal.)

See the chapter "d-4 Pseudoradial spaces" in {{mr:2049453}}.
