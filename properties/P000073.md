Every nonempty {P39} closed subspace of $X$ is
{P201}, witnessed by exactly one generic point.

(Spaces that may have multiple generic points are {P192}.)

See {{wikipedia:Sober_space}} and also the section on [Irreducible components](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/004U) from the Stacks project.
