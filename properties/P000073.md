Every nonempty irreducible closed subset of $X$ is the closure of exactly one point of $X$; that is, every nonempty irreducible closed subset has a unique *generic point*.
Here, a subset of $X$ is called *irreducible* if it is {P39} with the subspace topology.

See {{wikipedia:Sober_space}} and also the section on [Irreducible components](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/004U) from the Stacks project.
