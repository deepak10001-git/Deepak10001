A space in which points and closed sets can be separated by a function. 

Namely, given a closed set $A$ and a point $b \notin A$, there is a continuous function $f:X \rightarrow [0,1]$ such that $f(A) = \{0\}$ and $f(b)=1$.

Defined in 14.8 of {{mr:2048350}}.

Equivalently, the topology is induced by a uniformity.  See Theorem 38.2 in {{mr:2048350}} and {{wikipedia:Uniform_space}}.
