A completely regular space is one in which points and closed sets can be separated by a function.
In other words, a space is completely regular if, given a closed set $A$ and a point $b \notin A$, there is a continuous function $f:X \rightarrow [0,1]$ such that $f(A) = \{0\}$ and $f(b)=1$.

Defined in 14.8 of {{mr:MR2048350}}.

Equivalently, the topology is induced by a uniformity: {{wikipedia:Uniform_space}}.
