A space with a (finite or infinite) countable $k$-network.

Equivalently, a space with a countable pseudobase.

A family $\mathcal N$ of subsets of $X$ is called a *$k$-network* if for every compact set $K$ and open set $U$ in $X$ with $K\subseteq U$, there exists a finite $\mathcal{N}^* \subseteq \mathcal{N}$ with $K \subseteq \bigcup\mathcal{N}^* \subseteq U$.

And a family $\mathcal{N}$ of subsets of $X$ is called a *pseudobase* if for every compact set $K$ and open set $U$ in $X$ with $K\subseteq U$, there exists some $A\in\mathcal{N}$ with $K \subseteq A \subseteq U$.

For the equivalence between the two characterizations, note that every pseudobase is a $k$-network.  And conversely given a countable $k$-network $\mathcal N$, the collection of finite unions of elements of $\mathcal N$ is a countable pseudobase.
