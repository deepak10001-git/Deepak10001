Each point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open subset of $\mathbb R^n$
with its Euclidean topology for some $n$.  Equivalently, each point has a neighborhood
homeomorphic to $\mathbb R^n$ for some $n$. Note that this value is allowed
to differ between points.

In the case that $n=0$, the point having a neighborhood homeomorphic to
$\mathbb R^0=\{0\}$ means it is an isolated point.

Defined on page 316 of {{mr:3728284}} and on page 38 of {{mr:2766102}}.
