There exists some integer $n\ge 0$ such that each point of the
space has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open subset of $\mathbb R^n$
with its Euclidean topology.  Equivalently, each point has a neighborhood
homeomorphic to $\mathbb R^n$.

 In the case $n=0$, the point having a neighborhood homeomorphic to
 $\mathbb R^0=\{0\}$ means it is an isolated point.

Defined on page 316 of {{mr:3728284}} and on page 38 of {{mr:2766102}}.
