A space $X$ such that the diagonal $\Delta$ of $X\times X$ is k-closed, where k-closed is in terms of the {P140} property (see Wikipedia).  In other words, $\Delta\cap K$ is closed in $K$ for every compact subspace $K$ of $X\times X$.

Equivalently, every {P16} subspace is {P3}.

Equivalently, every {P16} subspace is closed in $X$ and {P130}.

The property is defined in section 2 of {{doi:10.1007/BF02194829}}, where Theorem 2.1 shows the equivalences above.

Note: this property is not to be confused with other variants of k-Hausdorff (e.g. {P171}), where k-closed is defined in terms of different notions of compactly generated space or k-space.
