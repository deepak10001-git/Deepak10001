A space $X$ for which, for any disjoint closed sets $A$ and $B$, there is a continuous function $f: X \rightarrow [0,1]$ such that $f^{-1}(\{0\}) = A$ and $f^{-1}(\{1\}) = B$.  Equivalently, a normal space in which every closed set is a $G_\delta$.  Equivalently, a space in which every closed set is a zero-set.

The equivalence between the three definitions (Vedenissoff's theorem) is shown for example in Theorem 1.5.19 of {{mr:MR1039321}} (under the assumption of a $T_1$ space, but the proof is equally valid without the $T_1$ assumption).  See also here: <https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/72138>.

Defined on page 16 of {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}} (as perfectly \(T_4\)).
