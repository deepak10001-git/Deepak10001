    name: Why are these two definitions of a perfectly normal space equivalent?
---

A space $X$ for which, for any disjoint closed sets $A$ and $B$, there is a
continuous function $f: X \rightarrow [0,1]$ such that $f^{-1}(\{0\}) = A$ and
$f^{-1}(\{1\}) = B$.  Equivalently, a {P13} space in which every closed set is a $G_\delta$.
Equivalently, a space in which every closed set is a zero-set.

The equivalence between the three definitions (Vedenissoff's theorem) is shown for example
in Theorem 1.5.19 of {{mr:1039321}} (under the assumption of a {P2} space, but the proof is
equally valid without this assumption).  See also {{mathse:72138}}.

Defined on page 16 of {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}} (as perfectly \(T_4\)).
