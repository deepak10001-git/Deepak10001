The space $X$ (with topology $\tau$) is {P2} and there is a linear order $<$ on $X$ such that every point has a local base of $\tau$-open neighborhoods consisting of order-convex sets.  (A subset $A$ of an ordered set $(X,<)$ is *order-convex* if for each $a,b\in A$ with $a<b$, $A$ contains all points of $X$ between $a$ and $b$.)

Equivalently, there is a linear order $<$ on $X$ such that the topology $\tau$ on $X$ contains the order topology induced by the order $<$ and every point has a local base of $\tau$-open neighborhoods consisting of order-convex sets.

Equivalently, $X$ is homeomorphic to a subspace of a {P133}.

For more details and the proof of these equivalences, see {{zb:0228.54026}} (<https://eudml.org/doc/268514>) and {{mathse:4917398}}.

Such spaces are also called *suborderable* (as an example, in {{doi:10.1016/j.topol.2017.09.030}}).
