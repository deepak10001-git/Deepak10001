A family $\mathcal U$ of open subsets of a topological space $X$ is called an $\omega$-cover if every finite subset of $X$ is contained in one of the members.

A space is $\omega$-Rothberger if it satisfies the selection principle $\mathsf S_1(\Omega,\Omega)$: for every sequence $\langle \mathscr U_n : n \in \omega \rangle$ of $\omega$-covers of $X$, there exist choices $U_n \in \mathscr U_n$ so that $\{ U_n :n \in \omega \}$ is an $\omega$-cover of $X$.

Equivalently, a space is $\omega$-Rothberger if each of its finite powers is {P68}.
