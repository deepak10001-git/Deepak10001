The space satisfies the selection principle $\mathsf S_1(\Omega,\Omega)$: for every sequence $\langle \mathscr U_n : n \in \omega \rangle$ of $\omega$-covers of $X$, there exist choices $U_n \in \mathscr U_n$ so that $\{ U_n :n \in \omega \}$ is an $\omega$-cover of $X$.
(A family $\mathcal U$ of open subsets of $X$ is called an *$\omega$-cover* if each finite subset of $X$ is contained in an element of $\mathcal U$ and $X \notin \mathcal U$.)

Equivalently, every finite power of $X$ is {P68}.

See {{doi:10.1090/S0002-9939-1988-0964873-0}}; the equivalence with every finite power being {P68} is on page 918.
