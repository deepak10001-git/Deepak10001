Every subspace of $X$ is {P88}.

Equivalently, every open subspace of $X$ is {P88}.

Equivalently, for every *separated family* $(F_i)_{i \in I}$  of subsets of $X$,
there exists a pairwise disjoint family of open sets $(U_i)_{i \in I}$ with $F_i \subseteq U_i$ for all $i$.

(The family $(F_i)_i$ is called a *separated family* if for each $i$, 
$F_i \cap \operatorname{cl}_X(\bigcup_{j \ne i}F_j) = \empty$,
that is, if the family of the $F_i$ is discrete in its union.)

The equivalence of the conditions above is Problem 5.5.1(a) in {{zb:0684.54001}}.
