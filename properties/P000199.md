The identity map of $X$ is *null-homotopic*. That is, the identity map of $X$ is [homotopic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy#Formal_definition) to a constant map. A continuous map $f : Y \to Z$ is *constant* if for all $y_1, y_2 \in Y$, $f(y_1) = f(y_2)$. This means the identity map of {S000163} is constant; see [constant morphism](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/constant+morphism#definition) for discussion of a possible alternative. Unwrapping definitions, there exists a continuous map $F : X \times [0, 1] \to X$ such that for all $x, x_1, x_2 \in X$, $F(x, 0) = x$, and $F(x_1, 1) = F(x_2, 1)$.


Equivalently, either $X = \emptyset$, or $X$ is [homotopy equivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy#Homotopy_equivalence) to {S000162}.
