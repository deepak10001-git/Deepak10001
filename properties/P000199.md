The identity map is homotopic to a constant map. That is, the identity map is *null-homotopic*.

Equivalently, $X$ is homotopy equivalent to a point.

Equivalently, there exists a point $p \in X$ and a continuous map $F : X \times [0, 1] \to X$, such that for all $x \in X$, $F(x, 0) = x$ and $F(x, 1) = p$.

Defined on page 330 in {{zb:0951.54001}}.
