A space with a (finite or infinite) countable network.

A family $\mathcal N$ of subsets of $X$ is called a *network* if every open set is the union of a subfamily of $\mathcal N$.  That is, for every open set $U$ and point $x\in U$ there is some $A\in\mathcal N$ with $x\in A\subseteq U$.

Defined on page 127 of {{mr:1039321}}.
