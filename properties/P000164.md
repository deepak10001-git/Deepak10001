The cardinality of the space is smaller than any of measurable cardinal.

A cardinal $\kappa$ is called measurable if $\kappa$ is uncountable and there exists a measure $\mu:2^\kappa\to \{0, 1\}$ such that 

1. $\mu$ is $\kappa$-additive: $\mu(\bigcup_{i\in I} A_i) = \sum_{i\in I} \mu(A_i)$ for any family $(A_i)_{i\in I}\subseteq 2^\kappa$ of pairwise disjoint sets with $|I| < \kappa$,

2. $\mu$ is non-trivial: $\mu(\kappa) = 1$ and $\mu(\{x\}) = 0$ for all $x\in \kappa$. 

Equivalently, $\kappa$ is an uncountable and there exists a free ultrafilter $\mathcal{U}$ on $\kappa$ such that $\mathcal{U}$ is $\kappa$-complete i.e. if $\mathcal{F}\subseteq \mathcal{U}$ and $|\mathcal{F}| < \kappa$ then $\bigcap\mathcal{F}\in \mathcal{U}$. (See {{wikipedia:Measurable_cardinal}} for more details).

Note: Some authors, for example {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4615-7819-2}}, refer to measurable cardinals as those cardinals $\kappa$ for which there exists a (countably additive) measure $\mu:2^\kappa\to \{0, 1\}$ which is non-trivial. If $\kappa$ is smallest such cardinal, then a non-trivial measure $\mu:2^\kappa\to \{0, 1\}$ is $\kappa$-additive (see corollary 10.7 of {{doi:10.1007/3-540-44761-X}}), so $\kappa$ is also measurable by above definition.

(Existence of a measurable cardinal cannot be proven in ZFC, so no space should ever have this property marked as false. See {T383}.)
