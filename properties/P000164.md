The cardinality $|X| = \kappa$ of the space is strictly smaller than the smallest measurable cardinal ({{wikipedia:Measurable_cardinal}}), if one exists. Equivalently, $\kappa$ is not a $\sigma$-measurable cardinal, what some authors ({{doi:10.1007/978-1-4615-7819-2}}) call measurable cardinals.

(Note that the existence of a measurable cardinal cannot be proven in ZFC, so no space should ever have this
property marked as false. See {T383}.)
