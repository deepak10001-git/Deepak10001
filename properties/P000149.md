A family $\mathcal U$ of open subsets of a topological space $X$ is called an $\omega$-cover if every finite subset of $X$ is contained in one of the members and $X \not\in \mathcal U$.

A space $X$ is an $\varepsilon$-space if every $\omega$-cover has a countable $\omega$-subcover. Equivalently, a space $X$ is a $\varepsilon$-space if every finite power of $X$ is
{P18}. See {{doi:10.1016/0166-8641(82)90065-7}}; the equivalence with every finite power being {P18} is on page 156.
