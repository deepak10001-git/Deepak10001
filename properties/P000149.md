Every $\omega$-cover of $X$ has a countable $\omega$-subcover.  (A family $\mathcal U$ of open subsets of $X$ is called an *$\omega$-cover* if each finite subset of $X$ is contained in an element of $\mathcal U$ and $X \notin \mathcal U$.)

Equivalently, every finite power of $X$ is {P18}.

See {{doi:10.1016/0166-8641(82)90065-7}}; the equivalence with every finite power being {P18} is on page 156.
