There are neighborhoods $U_x$ of each point $x\in X$ such that for any two $a,b\in X$ there is a homeomorphism $f: U_a\rightarrow U_b$ that maps $a$ to $b$.

In other terms, there is another space $Y$ with distinguished point $y\in Y$ such that for each $x\in X$ there is a homeomorphism from $Y$ to a neighborhood of $x$ taking $y$ to $x$.
