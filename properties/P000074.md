A space that is {P5} and has a countable network.  Here, a family $\mathcal{P}$ of subsets of $X$ is called a *network* if for every $x\in X$ and every neighborhood $U$ of $x$ there is some $P\in\mathcal P$ such that $x\in P\subseteq U$.

The notion was originally defined in section 10 of {{mr:206907}}, which is available at <https://www.jstor.org/stable/24901448>.
