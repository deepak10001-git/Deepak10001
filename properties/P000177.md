A space that is {P5} and has a $\sigma$-locally finite network.  Here, a family $\mathcal{P}$ of subsets of $X$ is called a *network* if for every $x\in X$ and every neighborhood $U$ of $x$ there is some $P\in\mathcal P$ such that $x\in P\subseteq U$.  And the family $\mathcal P$ is *$\sigma$-locally finite* if it is a countable union of locally finite families.

The notion was introduced by A. Okuyama (see {{doi:10.3792/pja/1195521153}}) without the {P5} condition.  But most later papers, for example {{doi:10.1016/j.topol.2015.05.085}}, assume {P5}.
