A family $\mathcal{P}$ of subsets of $X$ is called a network if for any open set $U \subseteq X$ there is some subfamily $\mathcal{P}' \subseteq \mathcal{P}$ with $U = \bigcup \mathcal{P}'$. A family of subsets of $X$ is called $\sigma$-locally finite if it is a countable union of locally finite families. $X$ is called a $\sigma$-space if it is $T_3$ and has a $\sigma$-locally finite network.
