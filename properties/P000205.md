The second player has a winning strategy in the *strong Choquet game*.

During round $0$
of this game, Player 1 chooses some $x_0\in X$ with an open neighborhood $U_0$,
and Player 2 chooses some open neighborhood $V_0\subseteq U_0$ of $x_0$. Then during
round $n+1$, Player 1 chooses some $x_{n+1}\in V_n$ with an open neighborhood $U_{n+1}\subseteq V_n$,
and Player 2 chooses some open neighborhood $V_{n+1}\subseteq U_{n+1}$ of $x_{n+1}$.
Player 2 wins this game provided $\bigcap\{U_n:n<\omega\}\not=\emptyset$.
