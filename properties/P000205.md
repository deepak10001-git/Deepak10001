A space $X$ for which
there is a "symmetric" $d$, i.e., a function $d:X^2\to[0,\infty)$
satisfying reflexivity ($d(x,y)=0\Leftrightarrow x=y$) and symmetry
($d(x,y)=d(y,x)$), such that a subset $U \subseteq X$ is open iff for each $x \in U$,
there is some $\varepsilon > 0$ with $B(x,\varepsilon)=\{y\in X:d(x,y)<\varepsilon\}$
being contained in $U$.

Equivalently, there exists a symmetric $d$ such that $Y \subseteq X$ is closed iff $d(p,Y)=\inf\{d(p,y):y\in Y\} > 0$ for all $p \in X \setminus Y$.

Defined in {{doi:10.2991/978-94-6239-216-8}}. Note that a symmetric is also called a semimetric (see
{P102}) in some sources. Thus, these sources,
such as {{doi:10.2307/2370790}}, use the term semimetrizable
to refer to {P205}.
