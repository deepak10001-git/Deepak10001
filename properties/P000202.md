There exists a point $p\in X$ whose only neighborhood is the entire space.

Equivalently:

- $p$ is contained in all nonempty closed sets.
- $p$ is a specialization of every point. See {{wikipedia:Specialization_(pre)order}}.
- The topology is coarser than or equal to an excluded point topology (e.g. {S12}).

Compare with {P201} and {P203}.
