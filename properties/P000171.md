A space $X$ such that the diagonal $\Delta$ of $X\times X$ is k-closed, where k-closed is in terms of the {P141} property (see Wikipedia).  In other words, the inverse image of $\Delta$ is closed for every continuous map from a
{P16} {P3} space to $X\times X$.

Equivalently, for every pair of continuous maps $f,g:K\to X$ with {P16} {P3} domain $K$,
the set $\{a\in K:f(a)=g(a)\}$ is closed in $K$.

An alternatively, for every {P16} {P3} space $K$ and
continuous map $f:K\to X$ and points $k,l\in K$ with $f(k)\not=f(l)$,
there exist open neighborhoods $U,V$ of $k,l$ with $f[U],f[V]$
disjoint. See 4.2.4 of <https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/Rezk_CompactlyGeneratedSpaces.pdf>.

See also <https://zbmath.org/0345.54025> for an earlier
reference to this weakening of {P3}.

Note: this property is not to be confused with other variants of k-Hausdorff (e.g. {P170}),
where k-closed is defined in terms of different notions of compactly generated space or k-space.
