A family $\mathcal U$ of open subsets of a topological space $X$ is called a $k$-cover if every compact subset of $X$ is contained in one of the members and $X \not\in \mathcal U$.

A space $X$ is $k$-Lindelöf if every open $k$-cover has a countable $k$-subcover.

Defined in Section 2 of {{mr:2777746}}.
