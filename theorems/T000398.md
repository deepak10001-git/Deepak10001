By {T351}, a {P5} {P147} is {P50}. Let $X$ be a {P5} {P147} and suppose some $x\in X$ is not isolated. Since $X$ is {P50} and {P2}, we can find a decreasing sequence $U_n$ of clopen neighbourhoods of $x$ such that $U_{n+1}$ is properly contained in $U_n$, and $U_0 = X$. Then $U_0, U_1\setminus U_0, U_2\setminus U_1, ...$ are non-empty clopen sets. Define $f:X\to\mathbb{R}$ by $f[U_0] = \{0\}$ and $f[U_{n+1}\setminus U_n] = \{n+1\}$. Then $f$ is continuous and unbounded.
