Since discrete spaces are homeomorphic precisely when they have the same cardinality, it suffices to show that for every cardinality $k$ there is a set of cardinality $k$ with a total order that induces the discrete topology.

Let $k$ be a cardinal number. If $k$ is finite, then any total order on $k$ induces the discrete topology. If $k$ is infinite, let $X=\alpha \times \mathbb{Z}$ where $\alpha$ is an ordinal of cardinality $k$, together with the lexicographical ordering. Then we see that $X$ with the order topology is discrete.
