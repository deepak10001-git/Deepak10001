Per Theorem 1 of {{zb:1400.39025}}, for any space $X$ satisfying the antecedent there exists an ultrafilter $mathscr U$ on $X$ such that each $U\in\mathscr U$ is open.
Suppose by contradiction that $A$ is an infinite compact subset of $X$. Write $A=B\cup C$ with $B,C$ infinite and disjoint. These two sets cannot both belong to $\mathscr U$; say $B\notin\mathscr U$. The set $B$ is closed in $X$, hence closed in $A$ and thus compact.
Every subset of $B$ is also not in $\mathscr U$, hence closed in $X$. So $B$ has the discrete topology. But an infinite discrete space cannot be compact.

For an alternative proof that does not make use of ultrafilter characterizations of door spaces, see {{mathse:4995501}}.
