Per Theorem 1 of {{zb:1400.39025}}, a space $X$ satisfying the antecedent has a topology $\mathcal T$ such that $\mathscr U=\mathcal T\setminus\{\varnothing\}$ is an ultrafilter on $X$.
Suppose by contradiction that $A$ is an infinite compact subset of $X$.  Write $A=B\cup C$ with $B,C$ infinite and disjoint.  These two sets cannot both belong to $\mathscr U$.  Say $B\notin\mathscr U$.  The set $B$ is closed in $X$, hence closed in $A$ and compact.
Every nonempty $D\subseteq B$ is also not in $\mathscr U$, hence closed in $X$.  So $B$ has the discrete topology.  But an infinite discrete space cannot be compact.
