Let $X$ be regular and extremally disconnected. If $p\in X$ and $U$ is an open neighbourhood of $p$, from {P000011} there exists an open $V$ with $p\in V\subseteq \overline{V}\subseteq U$. From {P000049}, $\overline{V}$ is clopen. Thus clopen sets in $X$ form a basis, that is $X$ is {P000050}.

See problem 170 on page 343 of {{mr:0785749}}.
