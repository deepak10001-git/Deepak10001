If a {P196} space is {P16}, then it must have a second largest open set 
(otherwise, $\mathcal T_X\setminus\{X\}$ would be totally ordered with no upper bound and therefore an open cover with no finite subcover).
Thus, any open cover must contain $X$, so it admits a refinement containing $X$ as the only nonempty set.
