Any clopen partition of a {P36} space $X$ must contain $X$, so to admit clopen refinements every open cover must contain $X$. Thus, the union of all open sets except for $X$ cannot equal $X$ (as that would be an open cover not containing $X$), so any sequence converges to all points outside of that union (whose only neighborhood is $X$).
