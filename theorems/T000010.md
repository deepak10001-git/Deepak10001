to say that if a space is:

P49 (extremally disconnected)
P84 (locally Hausdorff)
then it is P167 (sequentially discrete).


if:
  and:
  - P000049: true
  - P000084: true
then:
  P000167: true

Shown in the answer by Ulli to {{mathse:4751804}}.  Stated for Hausdorff spaces, but the proof generalizes by restricting to an open Hausdorff neighborhood of the limit point.
