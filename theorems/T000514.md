If $X$ is {P192}, {P39}, and nonempty, it has a generic point $x$. But by {P135}, every neighborhood of $x$ contains $\operatorname{cl}\{x\}=X$, i.e. $X$ is its only neighborhood. Then for any other point $y\in X$, no open set contains $x$ but not $y$, so $x$ and $y$ must be topologically indistinguishable by {P135}. Thus, all points in $X$ are topologically indistinguishable from each other, so $X$ is {P129}.
