  name: Is every ccc space weakly Lindel√∂f?
---

$wc(X)\leq c(X)$ where $wc(X)$ is the weak covering number of $X$ and $c(X)$ is the cellularity of $X$.
$X$ has CCC iff $c(X)\leq\aleph_0$ and is weakly Lindelof iff $wc(X)\leq \aleph_0$
Thus if $X$ has CCC, then it's weakly Lindelof.

See chapter 1, section 3 of {{doi:10.1016/c2009-0-12309-7}}.

Or see {{mathse:4743458}} for a direct proof.
