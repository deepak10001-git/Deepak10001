Let $(K, \tau)$ be maximal compact and assume that $K$ is not KC which means that there is a compact subset $A \subseteq K$ such that $K \setminus A$ is not $\tau$-open. Let $\tau'$ be the topology generated by the subbasis $\tau \cup \{ K \setminus A \}$. Then $\tau'$ is strictly finer than $\tau$. We show that $\tau'$ is compact by the Alexander subbasis theorem: Let $\mathcal{U} = \{ U_i \}_{i \in I} \subseteq \tau \cup \{ K \setminus A \}$ be an open cover of $K$ by subbasis elements for $\tau'$. If $\mathcal{U}$ does not contain $K\setminus A$ then $\mathcal{U}$ is an cover of $K$ by $\tau$-open sets and thus has a finite subcover since $K$ is compact.
Otherwise, $\mathcal{U}' := \mathcal{U} \setminus \{ K \setminus A \} \subseteq \tau$ is a cover of $A$ by $\tau$-open sets. Since $A$ is $\tau$-compact, $\mathcal{U}'$ has a finite subcover $\{ U_{i_1}, \dots, U_{i_n} \}$. But then $\{ U_{i_1}, \dots, U_{i_n}, K \setminus A \}$ is a finite subset of $\mathcal{U}$ which covers $K$. It follows that $(K, \tau')$ is compact, contradiction.
