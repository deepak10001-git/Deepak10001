Suppose the sequence $(x_n)$ converges to the point $a\in X$.  The set $A=\{x_n:n\in\mathbb N\}\cup\{a\}$ is compact, hence finite by {P136}.  Since $A$ is finite and $T_1$, it is discrete and the singleton $\{a\}$ is open in $A$.  As the sequence converges to $a$ in the subspace $A$ as well, the sequence is eventually constant with value $a$.
