Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space.
Write $B(x,\epsilon)$ for the open ball centered at $x$ with radius $\epsilon$.

The space is {P2}.

For $x\in U$ with $U$ open in $X$,
define $\mu(x,U)$ to be some open ball $B(x,\epsilon)$, $\epsilon>0$,
such that $B(x,2\epsilon)\subseteq U$.
The triangle inequality shows that $\mu(x,U)$ satisfies Definition (2) of {P109}.
