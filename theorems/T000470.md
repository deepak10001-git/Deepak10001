The partition elements of a {P86} {P185} space must all have the same cardinality, so the space is a product of a {P52} space and an {P129} space.
Given any nonzero cardinal, there is a group with that cardinality (for example, a cyclic group in the finite case and $\oplus_{k\in\kappa}\mathbb{Z}$ for infinite cardinal $\kappa$). When the group is given either the discrete or indiscrete topology, the group operations are continuous. Thus, the topological product of them admits a compatible group structure from the product group of the two.
