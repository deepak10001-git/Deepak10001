In a {P135} space, the closure of each point is contained in all of its open neighborhoods.
Then for any open set $U$ and point $p\in U$, consider the open cover $\{U, X\setminus\text{cl }\{p\}\}$.
A clopen refinement of this contains a clopen set $C$ with $p\in C\subseteq U$.
Thus, there is a basis of clopen sets.
