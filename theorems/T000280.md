See problem 30 on page 206 of {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}}. Following is the proof given in {{mathse:4787657}}.

Given a continuous non-constant function $f:I\to \omega$ where $\omega$ has *any* $T_1$ topology, for each point $x\in I$ and every neighborhood $N_x$, $f[N_x]$ is infinite. If not, take the $N_x$ for each $x$ with $f[N_x]$ finite. Then there's a finite subcover, showing that $f[I]$ is finite. But then $f[I]$ is a connected subspace of a finite $T_1$ (and thus discrete) space, showing it is a singleton, contradicting the assumption that $f$ is non-constant.

It follows that $f^\leftarrow[\omega\setminus\{0,\dots,n-1\}]$ is not only open for each $n<\omega$, but dense. So by the [Baire Category Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baire_category_theorem), we have that $\bigcap\{f^\leftarrow[\omega\setminus\{0,\dots,n-1\}]:n<\omega\}$ is dense. But $\bigcap\{f^\leftarrow[\omega\setminus\{0,\dots,n-1\}]:n<\omega\}$ must be $f^\leftarrow[\emptyset]=\emptyset$, a contradiction.
