Let $I$ be the interval $[0,1]$ and consider a path $f:I\to X$.
Suppose first that $X$ is {P57} and {P2}.  Each $f^{-1}(x)$ for $x\in X$ is a (possibly empty) closed subset of $I$.  The nonempty $f^{-1}(x)$ partition $I$ into countably many closed sets.  The number of these nonempty closed sets cannot be finite $>1$, since $I$ is connected.  And as shown in {{mo:48970}}, it cannot be countably infinite either (theorem of Sierpi≈Ñski (1918)).  So there is only one such closed set and $f$ is constant.

Suppose now that $X$ is {P93} and {P2}.  For each $t\in I$ the function $f$ maps some closed interval around $t$ to some countable subspace of $X$.  By the countable case above, $f$ is constant on that interval; so $f$ is locally constant.  A standard argument using the connectedness of $I$ then implies that $f$ is constant.
