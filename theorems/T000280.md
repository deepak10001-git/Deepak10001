See problem 30 on page 206 of {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}}.

Suppose $X$ is countable and $T_1$.  If $X$ is finite (and $T_1$), it is discrete and hence totally path disconnected.  Otherwise, $X$ is countably infinite.  A path in $X$ is a continuous function $f:[0,1]\to X$, and it remain continuous if the topology on $X$ is replaced by a coarser one.  So it is enough to show that {S15} is totally path disconnected, which is the case.  See also {{mo:48970}} for this last fact.
