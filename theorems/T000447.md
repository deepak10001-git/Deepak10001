If $X$ is a non-$T_0$ space, then there exist distinct points $x,y\in X$ which have the same open neighborhoods.
Then any selfmap $f: X\rightarrow X$ that maps into the set $\\{x, y\\}$ is continuous as $f^{-1}(U)$ is either $X$ or $\varnothing$ for any open set $U\subseteq X$.
We may then easily select such maps without fixed points by requiring that $f(x)=y$ and $f(y)=x$.
