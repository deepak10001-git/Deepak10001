See the discussion about {S23} in [this answer](https://mathoverflow.net/a/435257/458159) to {{mo:434451}}.  Suppose $X$ satisfies the hypotheses.  Take $A\subseteq X$.  We have to show $A$ is closed.  By {P140} it's enough to show that $A\cap K$ is closed in $K$ for every compact $K\subseteq X$.  But $A\cap K$ is finite (since $K$ is finite by {P136}) and is closed as a finite union of closed points (since $X$ is $T_1$).
