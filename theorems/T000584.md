Suppose $X \neq \emptyset$, and let $p \in X$. Define a homotopy $F : X \times [0, 1] \to X$ from the identity map to the constant map with value $p$ as follows. For all $x \in X$ and $t \in (0, 1]$, $F(x, 0) = x$ and $F(x, t) = p$. $F$ is continuous because any function into an indiscrete space is continuous.
