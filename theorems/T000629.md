Let $G$ be a non-{P52} {P130} {P3} topological group. Let $\mu$ be a Haar measure on $G$. If $\mu$ is finite, we shall normalize it so that $\mu(G) = 1$. As $G$ is non-discrete, $\mu$ has no atoms. Thus, for each $g \in G$ and $n \ge 1$, we have $\mu(\{g\}) = 0$, so by outer regularity there exists an open set $U_{g,n}$ containing $g$ with $\mu(U_{g,n})<2^{-n}$. Let $\mathcal{U}_n=\{U_{g,n}:g\in G\}$, which is an open cover of $G$ for all $n$. If $V_n \in \mathcal{U}_n$, then,

$$\mu\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty V_n\right) \le \sum_{n=1}^\infty \mu(V_n) < \sum_{n=1}^\infty 2^{-n} = 1 \le \mu(G)$$

So, $\{V_n\}_n$ does not cover $G$ and $G$ is not {P68}.

This proof was inspired by {{mathse:740634}}.
