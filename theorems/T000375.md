Theorem 6 of {{doi:10.1007/s10114-005-0753-8}} states that a space $X$ is $k$-Menger if and only if $X^m$ is $k$-Menger for every positive integer $m$. To see that a $k$-Menger space is Menger in each of its finite powers, it suffices to see that a space being $k$-Menger is Menger. Indeed, given any sequence $\langle \mathscr U_n : n \in \omega \rangle$ of open covers of a $k$-Menger space $X$, we can form $\mathscr V_n$ to be the finite unions of elements of $\mathscr U_n$. Then $\mathscr V_n$ is a $k$-cover of $X$. We can apply the $k$-Menger selection principle to produce a $k$-cover of $X$ and note that such a selection corresponds to finite selections from each $\mathscr U_n$ which result in a cover of $X$.
