If $p \in X$ is a cut point, then $X \setminus \{p\} = U \cup V$, with $U, V$ disjoint, nonempty, and open in $X \setminus \{p\}$. For $X$ to be ultraconnected, $U \cup \{p\}$ and $V \cup \{p\}$ must be closed in $X$, so $\{p\}$ must also be closed in $X$. This then implies $\{p\}$ must be a subset of every nonempty closed set, from which the claim follows.
