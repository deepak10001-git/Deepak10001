Consider a point $x$ with unique smallest neighborhood $U$. For a local homeomorphism $f$ taking $x$ to $y$, $f(x)$ must be the unique smallest neighborhood of $y$. Thus, either $f(U)=U$ and $x$ and $y$ are topologically indistinguishable, or $x\not\in f(U)$ and $y\not\in U$ (as otherwise $f(U)\cap U$ would be a smaller neighborhood of either $x$ or $y$), so we find that each has a neighborhood not containing the other.
