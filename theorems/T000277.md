For the result with the stronger hypothesis of {P133} in place of {P154}, see Theorem 2.2 in {{doi:10.1090/S0002-9939-1969-0248762-3}}.

The general result with {P154} is Proposition 2.10(b) in {{zb:0228.54026}} (<https://eudml.org/doc/268514>) and is proved as follows.  Suppose $X$ is a GO-space satisfying the CCC condition.  It can be topologically embedded as a dense subspace of a LOTS $Y$ (see for example {{mathse:4917398}}).  Since $X$ is dense in $Y$, the space $Y$ also satisfies CCC, hence is {P131} by the first result.  The conclusion then follows since {P131} is a hereditary property.
