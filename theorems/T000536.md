If a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\mathbb R^n$ and a neighborhood homeomorphic
to $\mathbb R^m$ intersect, their intersection must be homeomorphic to open sets
in both $\mathbb R^n$ and $\mathbb R^m$. Since $\mathbb R^n=\mathbb R^m$ only if
$n=m$, any connected component of a {P122} space must be of a single dimension.
