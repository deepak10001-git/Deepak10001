Shown in the proof of Theorem 2.8 in {{zb:0153.52404}} (<https://www.jstor.org/stable/43699115>):

Suppose $\mathcal N=\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty\mathcal N_n$ is a network for $X$, with each $\mathcal N_n$ locally finite.  By regularity, we can assume all the element of $\mathcal N$ are closed.  Given an open set $U$, let $F_n=\bigcup\{A\in\mathcal N_n:A\subseteq U\}$.  Then $F_n$ is closed and $U=\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty F_n$ is an $F_\sigma$.
