See Theorem 4.4 of {{mr:0776620}}, or {{mathse:2995939}}, and note that the proofs, though stated with the assumptions of first-countability and Hausdorff, only use the former to establish $X$ is sequential, and only use the latter to establish that it is $US$.

Note also that density $\leq\mathfrak c$ is sufficient.
