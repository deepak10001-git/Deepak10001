See Theorem 4.4 of {{mr:0776620}}, or {{mathse:2995939}}, and note that though the proofs are stated with the assumption that $X$ is {P28} and {P3}, the former property is only used to establish that $X$ is {P79}, and the latter is only used to establish that $X$ is {P99}.

Note also that density $\leq\mathfrak c$ is sufficient.
