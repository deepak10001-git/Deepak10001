See [Theorem 4.2](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Stone_Spaces/CiWwoLNbpykC?gbpv=1&pg=PA69) in {mr:0861951}.

Additionally, by Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras, a {P193} is the spectrum of a boolean algebra, which is a special case of a commutative ring, whose spectra are represented by {P75} spaces.
