Stated as evident in the first sentence of the proof of Satz 1 in {{doi:10.4064/fm-61-1-79-81}}.

Given a subset $A$ of a {P133} space $X$, a point $p\in\overline A\setminus A$ is in the closure of the part of $A$ to one side of $p$, say the left side.  So the set $B=\{a\in A:a<p\}$ has no maximum point and is cofinal in the set of points of $X$ to the left of $p$.  As $B$ is totally ordered, it admits a well-ordered cofinal subset and that set corresponds to a transfinite sequence of points of $A$ converging to $p$.
