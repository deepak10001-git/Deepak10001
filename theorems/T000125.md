Let $\tau$ be the topology on $X$ and let $<$ be the order on $X$ in the definition of {P154}, with corresponding order topology $\sigma$.  Then $\sigma\subseteq\tau$ and the identity map $(X,\tau)\to(X,\sigma)$ is a continuous bijection from a compact space to a Hausdorff space, hence a homeomorphism.  So $\tau=\sigma$.

See Lemma 6.1 in {{zb:0228.54026}} (<https://eudml.org/doc/268514>).
