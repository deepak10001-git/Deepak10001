Suppose $X$ is countable and let $\{ F_n : n \in \omega \}$ be an enumeration of the non-empty finite subsets of $X$. In the $n^{\mathrm{th}}$ inning of the game, given an $\omega$-cover $\mathscr U_n$ of $X$, let $U_n \in \mathscr U_n$, be so that $F_n \subseteq U_n$. Note that this defines a winning Markov strategy for Two in the $\omega$-Rothberger game.
