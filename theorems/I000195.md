Given $a,b\in X$ with $a\neq b$. We want to show that $a$ has a neighborhood that does not contain $b$. Since $X$ is locally $T_2$, there is an open neighborhood $U\subseteq X$ of $a$ which is Hausdorff. If $b\notin U$, the claim is proved. Assume now $b\in U$. Then $a$ und $b$ have disjoint open neighborhoods in $U$ which are also open in $X$. This finishes the proof.
