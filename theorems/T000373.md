See Theorem 3.22 of {{mr:3991109}}.

Let $\langle K_n : n \in \omega \rangle$ be a sequence of compact sets so that every compact $K \subseteq X$ is a subset of $K_n$ for some $n$.

In the $n^{\mathrm{th}}$ inning of the game, Two need only pick $U_n$ so that $K_n \subseteq U_n$. This is a Markov strategy.
