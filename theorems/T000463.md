For the result with the stronger hypothesis of {P133} in place of {P154}, see {{mathse:4913495}} and Problem 6.3.2(c) in {{zb:0684.54001}}.

For the general result, suppose $X$ is a {P154} that is {P27}.  {{mathse:4925245}} shows that $X$ can be homeomorphically embedded into a {P27} {P133} space $Y$.  The space $Y$ is {P97} by the first result.  The conclusion then follows since {P97} is a hereditary property.
