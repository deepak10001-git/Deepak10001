The main result of {{mr:1475806}} (available at <https://eudml.org/doc/40507>) shows that {P133} spaces have covering dimension no greater than 1.  And on the other hand {P27} {P133} spaces are {P53} by the Urysohn metrization theorem.  The result then follows from Theorem 1.11.4 of {{mr:0482697}}.
