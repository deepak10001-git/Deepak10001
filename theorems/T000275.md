Let $S$ be a countable dense set in the totally ordered space $X$. Since $S$ is countable and totally ordered, there is an order-preserving function $f:S\to \mathbb{Q}\cap (0,1)$. Since $X$ is second countable, it is first countable and therefore Fr√©chet Urysohn. Thus $f$ can be extended to an order-preserving function $F:X\to [0,1]$. Since $X$ is $T_2$ the extension is unique. Define $d:X\times X \to \mathbb{R}$ by $d(x, y) = d(F(x), F(y))$.
