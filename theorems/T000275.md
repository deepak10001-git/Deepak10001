Let $X$ be a connected linearly ordered topological space with countable dense subset $Q$.
Then the collection of all open intervals and rays of the form $(p, q)$ with $p,q\in Q\cup \{-\infty, \infty\}$ forms a countable base for $X$.
To see this, let $x\in(a,b)$ - as $X$ is connected, $(a,x)$ and $(x,b)$ are nonempty, so choose $p\in(a,x)\cap Q$ and $q\in(x,b)\cap Q$.
