Let $\sigma(\mathcal{U}, n)$ be a winning Markov strategy for $F$ in the Menger game, and $\mathfrak{C}$ collect all open covers of $X$. Then for
$$
        R_n = \bigcap_{\mathcal{U}\in\mathfrak{C}} \bigcup\sigma(\mathcal{U},n)
$$
it follows that $R_n$ is relatively compact to $X$, and $\bigcup_{n<\omega} R_n = X$.
