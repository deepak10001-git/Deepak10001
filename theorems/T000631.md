    name: Cut-point spaces (Honari & Bahrampour)
---

We show that a cut point $p \in X$ is either an isolated point or a closed point. By definition of cut point, $X$ is connected, and $X \backslash \{p\} = A \cup B$ for disjoint clopen sets $A$ and $B$. Hence there is a open set $V$ such that $A = V \cap (X \backslash \{p\}) = V \backslash \{p\}$, and there is a closed set $F$ such that $A = F \cap (X \backslash \{p\}) = F \backslash \{p\}$. Since $X$ is connected, $V \neq F$. Thus, either $F \backslash V = \{p\}$ or $V \backslash F = \{p\}$. In the first case $p$ is a closed point, and in the second case $p$ is an isolated point.

This argument is from Theorem 3.2 of {{doi:10.1090/S0002-9939-99-04839-X}}.
