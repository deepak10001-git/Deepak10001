In a {P168} space every countable subspace is discrete (as each of its subsets is itself closed in $X$).  Now if $A$ is an infinite compact subset of $X$, it contains a countably infinite subset $B$, which is closed in $X$, hence closed in $A$ and itself compact.  That is impossible since $B$ is discrete.
