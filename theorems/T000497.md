If every point has a local base of compact neighborhoods and every compact set is closed, every point has a local base of closed neighborhoods.  Thus the space is {P11}.

The conclusion can then be strenghthened to {P6} using other theorems known to Ï€-Base.
Specifically, note that {P130} and {P11} implies {P12} [(Explore)](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces?q=Locally+Compact%2BRegular%2B%7ECompletely+regular)
and {P100} implies {P2} [(Explore)](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces?q=KC%2B%7Et1).
