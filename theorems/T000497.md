---

If every point has a local base of compact neighborhoods and every compact set is closed, every point has a local base of closed neighborhoods.  Thus the space is {P11}.

The conclusion can then be strenghthened to {P6} using other theorems known to pi-base.
Specifically, combine the results that [Locally compact regular spaces are completely regular](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces?q=Locally+Compact%2BRegular%2B%7ECompletely+regular) and [KC spaces are $T_1$](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces?q=KC%2B%7Et1).
