A characterization of {P170} in {{doi:10.1007/BF02194829}}
is that all {P16} subsets are closed and {P130}.

To see that {P16} subsets being {P3} implies
{P16} subsets are closed, let $K$ be {P16}, and $x\in X\setminus K$.
Then $K\cup\{x\}$ is {P16} and thus {P3}, and contains a {P16} and thus
closed subspace $K$. It follows that $\{x\}$ is open in $K\cup\{x\}$ and thus
$X$ has an open neighborhood of $x$ missing $K$.
