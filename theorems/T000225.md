Given a point $x\in X$, the intersection of a countable local base at $x$ is contained in every neighborhood of $x$ and is a neighborhood of $x$ by {P147}.  So every point has a smallest neighborhood.

Asserted in a comment to {{mathse:832888}} in the special case that {P28} {P147} {P2} spaces are {P52}.
