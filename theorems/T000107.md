Let $X$ be metacompact and countably compact. Suppose $\mathcal{U}$ is an open cover and let $\mathcal{V}$ be a point-finite open refinement. Consider the set $A$ of subcollections of $\mathcal{V}$ that cover $X$ ordered by reverse inclusion. Using the point-finiteness of $\mathcal{V}$, one may see that the intersection of a chain in $A$ is also a cover of $X$. By Zorn's Lemma, $A$ has a $\supseteq$-maximal element, $\mathcal{V}'$, which therefore is an irreducible cover of $X$ (no proper subcollection of $\mathcal{V}'$ covers $X$). Since $X$ is countably compact, $\mathcal{V}'$ must actually be finite. Otherwise, if $\mathcal{V}''$ is a countably infinite subcollection of $\mathcal{V}'$, let $V = \bigcup(\mathcal{V}' \setminus \mathcal{V}'')$ and note that the countable cover $\mathcal{V}'' \cup \{V\}$ has no finite subcover, contradicting countably compact.
