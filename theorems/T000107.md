Theorem 1 and the following Remark of {{doi:10.1016/c2009-0-12309-7}}: every point-countable open cover
without a countable subcover witnesses a sequence without a cluster point.
Thus if a space is {P19}, every point-countable open cover
must have a countable subcover; and by {P19} again we have a finite subcover.
It follows by {P83} that every open cover has a finite refinement, proving
{P16}.
