Let $\alpha$ be an ordinal space greater than $\omega_1+1$ (the {S36}), then $\{\omega_1\}$ is a closed subset of $\alpha$ that is not $G_\delta$: If $((\alpha_n,\omega_1])_{n\in\omega}$ is a sequence of open interval containing $\omega_1$, then every countable ordinal that is greater than all $\alpha_n$ is contained in the intersection $\cap_{n<\omega} (\alpha_n,\omega_1]$. For the fact that the {S35} is not {P15}, see item C of <https://dantopology.wordpress.com/2009/10/11/the-first-uncountable-ordinal>.
