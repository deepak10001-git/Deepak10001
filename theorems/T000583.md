    name: A contractible space is path connected.
---

Suppose $X$ is contractible, and let $x_0, x_1 \in X$. By assumption there exists some point $p \in X$ and a continuous map $F : X \times [0, 1] \to X$ that, in particular, determines paths from $x_0$ and $x_1$ to $p$. Obtain a path from $x_0$ to $x_1$ by concatenating the path from $x_0$ to the reverse of the path from $x_1$.
