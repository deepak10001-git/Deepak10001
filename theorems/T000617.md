One of the characterizations of Baire spaces (see {{wikipedia:Baire_space}}) is that every nonempty open set is nonmeager.

Suppose $p$ is a generic point of $X$ and let $U$ be a nonempty open set.  Then $p\in U$, and $p$ is not contained in any nowhere dense subset of $U$ since $\{p\}$ is dense in $U$.  Therefore $U$ is not meager.
