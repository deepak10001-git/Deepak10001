See Theorem 5 in <https://arxiv.org/abs/0708.2136>.  The smallest (open) neighborhood $U$ of a point $x$ in an Alexandrov space is always compact.  Indeed, in $U$ itself with the subspace topology any open cover of $U$ contains a neighbourhood of $x$ included in $U$. Such a neighbourhood is necessarily equal to $U$, so the open cover admits $\{U\}$ as a finite subcover.
