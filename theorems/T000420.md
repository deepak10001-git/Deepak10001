Assume $x,y$ are separated by the disjoint open sets $U,V$. Let $U_{r}=int(cl(U))$. 
Note that $U_{r}\cap V\subseteq cl(U)\cap V$, and since no point of $V$ may be a limit point of $U$ 
($V$ it itself a neighborhood of the point missing $U$), we have $cl(U)\cap V=\emptyset$ and therefore 
$U_{r}\cap V=\emptyset$. In particular, $x\in U_r$ and $y\not\in U_r$.
