Assume $x,y$ are separated by the disjoint open sets $U,V$. Let $U_{r}=int(cl(U))$ be regular open.
It follows that $U\cap V=\emptyset$ implies $cl(U)\cap V=\emptyset$,
since no point of $V$ may be a limit point of $U$.
Therefore $U_{r}\cap V=int(cl(U))\cap V=\emptyset$;
in particular, $x\in U_r$ and $y\not\in U_r$.
