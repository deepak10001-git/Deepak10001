By Exercise 3.12.4(a) in {{mr:1039321}} the character of a linearly ordered topological space does not exceed its cellularity.  So if a LOTS satisfies CCC, it is first countable.

See Lemma 5 in <https://web.math.pmf.unizg.hr/glasnik/skenirano/mardesicpapic1962.pdf>, noting that the compactness assumption is not used.
