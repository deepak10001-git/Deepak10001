For the result with the stronger hypothesis of {P133} in place of {P154}, Exercise 3.12.4(a) in {{zb:0684.54001}} states that the character of a linearly ordered topological space does not exceed its cellularity.  So if a LOTS satisfies CCC, it is first countable.  See Lemma 5 in <https://web.math.pmf.unizg.hr/glasnik/skenirano/mardesicpapic1962.pdf>, noting that the compactness assumption is not used.

For the general result with {P154}, suppose $X$ is a GO-space satisfying the CCC condition.  It can be topologically embedded as a dense subspace of a LOTS $Y$ (see for example {{mathse:4917398}}).  Since $X$ is dense in $Y$, the space $Y$ also satisfies CCC, hence is {P28} by the first result.  The conclusion then follows since {P28} is a hereditary property.
