    name: Is there a generalized order space $X$ with countable tightness which is not first countable?
---

Shown by KP Hart at {{mo:312803}}. To see this,
suppose $X$ is a {P154} for some linear order $<$ and let $a\in X$.

If $a$ is not isolated to the left (that is, in $(\leftarrow,a]$), it is in the closure of $(\leftarrow,a)$ and by {P81} there is a countably infinite set $C\subseteq(\leftarrow,a)$ with $a=\sup C$.  We can then extract a strictly increasing sequence $(x_n)$ in $C$ with $a=\sup x_n$.  Similarly, if $a$ is not isolated to the right, there is a strictly decreasing sequence $(y_n)$ with $a=\inf y_n$.

So, if $a$ is not isolated on either side, any neighborhood of $a$ contains an order-convex neighborhood, which necessarily contains points on either side of $a$, and hence contains an interval $(x_n,y_n)$.  Thus the collection of intervals $(x_n,y_n)$ forms a countable local base at $a$.  And if $a$ is isolated on one side or both, one can take the collection of intervals $(x_n,a]$ or $[a,y_n)$ or the singleton $\{a\}$.
