Any clopen partition of a {P36} space $X$ must contain $X$, so every open cover admitting a clopen partition as refinement must contain $X$. Thus, the union of all open sets except for $X$ cannot equal $X$ (as that would be an open cover not containing $X$), so some points have $X$ as their only neighborhood. By homogeneity, this must then be true of all points, i.e. the space is {P129}.
