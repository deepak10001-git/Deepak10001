Obvious if $|A|<\omega$. Otherwise cover $cl(A)$ with countable open sets. Let $x\sim y$ if there is a finite linked chain in this collection joining them. Since $x\sim a$ for some $a\in A$, there are at most $|A|$ distinct equivalence classes of size at most $\omega$. Thus $|cl(A)|=|A|\otimes\omega=|A|$.
