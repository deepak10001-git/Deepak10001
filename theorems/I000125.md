Let $\mathcal{B}=\{U_n\}_{n \in \omega}$ be a countable basis for $X$. Then for any $x \in X$, $\{U \in B\,|\,x \in U\}$ is a countable local basis at $x$.

For each $n \in \omega$, let $x_n \in U_n$. Then $\{x_n\}$ is a countable dense subset.

If $X$ is second countable, each open set is a union of at most countably many basis elements. Thus any open cover of $X$ contains at most countably many distinct elements.
