    name: Every sequence has a monotone subsequence
---

Every sequence in a totally ordered set has a monotone subsequence (see for example {{mathse:1706258}}). The space being {P19} implies that this subsequence has an accumulation point $x$.  And because the subsequence is monotone, it converges to $x$ because every order-convex neighborhood of $x$ contains eventually the subsequence as it contains infinitely many terms of it.
