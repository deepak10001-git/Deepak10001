    name: Every sequence has a monotone subsequence
---

Every sequence in a totally ordered set has a monotone subsequence (see for example {{mathse:1706258}}). The space being {P19} implies that this subsequence has an accumulation point, and every order-convex open neighborhood of the accumulation point contains eventually the subsequence as it contains infinitely many terms.
