Let $X$ be separable and metacompact. If $\{U_\alpha\}$ is an open cover with no countable subcover, let $\{V_\beta\}$ be a point finite refinement. Then $\{V_\beta\}$ is uncountable and so some point of the countable dense set is in uncountably many $V_\beta$.

Asserted in 2.2 of {{mr:MR1416131}}
(where Lindelof is called "finally compact").
