Given separated $A,B \subset X$ for each $a \in A$ there is some $\epsilon_a$ such that $B(a,\epsilon_a)$ is disjoint from $B$ and similarly for each $b \in B$. Then $O_A = \cup_{a \in A} B(a,\frac{\epsilon_a}{2})$ and $O_B = \cup_{b \in B} B(b,\frac{\epsilon_b}{2})$ are disjoint open sets containing $A$ and $B$ respectively.
