The shrinking property is motivated as a generalization of {P13} in {{zb:0712.54016}}. The argument there for {P193} implies {P13} goes as follows. Suppose $E$ and $F$ are disjoint closed subsets of a shrinking space $X$. Then $\{ X \setminus E , X \setminus F\}$ is an open cover of $X$, so there exists an open cover $\{U, V\}$ of $X$ such that $\mathrm{cl}_X(U) \subseteq X \setminus E$ and $\mathrm{cl}_X(V) \subseteq X \setminus F$. Note then that $E \subseteq X \setminus \mathrm{cl}_X(U)$, $F \subseteq X \setminus \mathrm{cl}_X(V)$, and $\left( X \setminus \mathrm{cl}_X(U) \right) \cap \left( X \setminus \mathrm{cl}_X(V) \right) = X \setminus \left( \mathrm{cl}_X(U) \cup \mathrm{cl}_X(V) \right) = \emptyset$.

The implication that {P193} implies {P32} appears in the diagram on page 191 of {{zb:0712.54016}} and is mentioned in passing in {{zb:1059.54001}} on page 199.
