Given a set $A\subseteq X$ and a point $p\in \overline{A}$, by {P81} there is some countable subset $D\subseteq A$ with $p\in\overline{D}$. Since $X$ is radial there is a transfinite sequence in $D$ converging to $p$.  Then, as explained in {{mathse:4785088}}, there exists a countable sequence of points in $D$ (and also a fortiori in $A$) converging to $p$.
