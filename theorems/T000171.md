If $X$ is {P50} (and therefore {P52}), then any two distinct points are open and disjoint. Otherwise, take a point $x\in X$. It has an open neighborhood $U$ homeomorphic to an open subset of $\mathbb R^n$ with $n \ge 1$. This open set $U$ contains two disjoint nonempty open sets, themselves open in $X$.
