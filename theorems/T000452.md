Asserted in  {{mathse:4862626}}.  Follows from the fact that {P30} and {P11} imply {P13} (proved in the second half of {{mr:1039321}} Theorem 5.1.5), together with the fact that {P30} and {P13} imply {P34}, as proved in {{mathse:4862626}}.  

Note that while {{mr:1039321}} defines paracompact spaces to be {P3}, neither {P3} nor even {P2} are required to upgrade from {P11} to {P13} in the second half of the proof of Theorem 5.1.5.
