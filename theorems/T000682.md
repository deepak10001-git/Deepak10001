Denote the specialization preorder on $X$ by $x\le y$ if $x\in\overline{\{y\}}$.
It's a partial order since $X$ is {P1}.

Let $f:X\to X$ be a continuous map.  So $x\le y$ implies $f(x)\le f(y)$.
Let $p$ be the (unique by {P1}) generic point of $X$; that is, $p\ge x$ for all $x$.
In particular, $p\ge f(p)$.
Now repeatedly apply $f$ to both sides of this inequality.
Writing $p_0=p$ and $p_n=f(p_{n-1})$, $n=1,2,\dots$ for convenience,
one gets a sequence of points that is (not necessarily strictly) decreasing for the specialization order:

$\quad p\ge p_1\ge p_2\ge\cdots$.

This corresponds to a (not necessarily strictly) decreasing sequence of closed sets

$\quad \overline{\{p\}}\supseteq \overline{\{p_1\}}\supseteq \overline{\{p_2\}}\supseteq\cdots,$

with each $p_n$ the unique generic point of $\overline{\{p_n\}}$.
By the {P208} property, there must be some $n$ such that
$\overline{\{p_{n-1}\}}=\overline{\{p_n\}}$, and hence  $p_{n-1}=p_n$;
that is, $p_{n-1}$ is a fixed point of $f$.
