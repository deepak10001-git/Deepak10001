  name: Is a Ïƒ-locally finite collection of open sets locally countable?
---

Every locally finite collection of nonempty open sets in a {P62} space is countable.
(Proof: Let $\mathcal V$ be such a collection.  Each $x \in X$ has an open neighborhood 
$N_x$ meeting only finitely many members of $\mathcal{V}$. As $X$ is {P62}, there are 
$x_n$ for $n<\omega$ such that $\{N_{x_n}:n<\omega\}$ covers a dense subset of $X$. Since
each member of $ \mathcal{V}$ meets some $N_{x_n}$, $\mathcal{V}$ is necessarily countable.)

Therefore any $\sigma$-locally finite base in a {P62} space is countable, and a {P62}
space with a $\sigma$-locally finite base is {P27}.
