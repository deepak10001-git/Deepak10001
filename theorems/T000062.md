  name: Is a Ïƒ-locally finite collection of open sets locally countable?
---

Let $\mathcal{V}$ be a locally finite collection. For each $x \in X$, there is a neighborhood 
$N_x$ meeting finitely many members of $\mathcal{V}$. As $X$ is {S62}, there are 
$x_n$ for $n<\omega$ such that $\{N_{x_n}:n<\omega\}$ covers a dense subset of $X$. Then each 
member of $ \mathcal{V}$ meets some $N_{x_n}$, showing $ \mathcal{V}$ is countable.

Therefore any $\sigma$-locally finite base in a {S62} space is countable, showing 
the space is {P27}.
