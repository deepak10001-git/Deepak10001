    name: Separability, the countable chain condition and the Lindelöf property in linearly orderable spaces (Lutzer & Bennet)
---

Take a collection $\mathscr{U}$ of pairwise disjoint nonempty open sets.  Since the space is hereditary Lindelöf, the union $\cup\mathscr{U}$ is Lindelöf, and it is covered by the collection $\mathscr{U}$ of open sets and by no smaller subcollection.  So $\mathscr{U}$ must be countable.

The result is stated in {{doi:10.1090/S0002-9939-1969-0248762-3}}.
