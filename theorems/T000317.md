    name: Every scattered topological space is a Baire space
---

In a scattered space every nonempty subset, in particular every nonempty open set, has an isolated point.  So every nonempty open set is nonmeager by {T314}, which is one of characterizations of Baire spaces (see {{wikipedia:Baire_space}}).

See also {{mathse:4565320}}.
