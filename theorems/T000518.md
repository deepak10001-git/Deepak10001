Let $x \in X$. As $X$ is {P174}, then $x$ has a neighborhood base, let's denote as $\mathcal{B}$, totally ordered by reverse inclusion. And, as $X$ is {P191}, then $\exists \{A_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ collection of open sets such that $\bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}}A_n = \{x\}$.

For each, $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $\exists B_n \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $B_n \subseteq A_n$. $\{B_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is countable, totally ordered by reverse inclusion and it verifies that $\bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}}B_n = \{x\}$. 

Let A be a neighborhood of $x$. Then $\exists B \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $B \subseteq A$. Suppose that $\nexists B_n \in \{B_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ such that $B_n \subseteq B$. Then, $B \subsetneq B_n, \forall n \in \mathbb{N}$, and $B \subseteq \bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}}B_n = \{x\}$. As a result, we conclude that $B = \{x\}$.

Therefore, $X$ is {P28}.
