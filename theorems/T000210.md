Given a transfinite sequence with values in a set $A$ and converging to a point $p\in X$, first replace it by a tail end belonging to a countable neighborhood of $p$ by {P93}. So we can assume without loss of generality that $A$ is countable.  Then, as explained in {{mathse:4785088}}, there exists a countable sequence of points of $A$ converging to $p$.
