Let $A$ be the intersection of all nonempty closed subsets of $X$, which is closed. Since $X$ is
{P202}, $A$ is nonempty as it contains any focal point of $X$. But it is also easy to
see that, for any $x \in A$, $\overline{\{x\}} = A$. Thus, if $A$ contains more than one point, $X$ cannot be {P1}, so
$A$ is a singleton and $X$ has a closed point.
