Let $p \in X$ be a cut point, and let $A$, $B$ be open sets such that $(A \cap B) \cap (X\setminus\{p\}) = \emptyset$ and $(A \cup B) \cap (X\setminus\{p\}) = X\setminus\{p\}$. Since $X$ is {P36}, either $p \in (A \cup B)$ or $p \notin (A \cup B)$, i.e, either $p$ is open or $p$ is closed. Suppose that $p$ is open. Since $X$ is {P86}, $X$ is {P52}. Therefore, $p$ is closed and $X$ is {P2}.
