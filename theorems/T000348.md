This is essentially the Birkhoff-Kakutani theorem (<https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2011/05/17/the-birkhoff-kakutani-theorem/>), which says that a topological group is metrizable if and only if it is Hausdorff and first countable.  The current version without Hausdorff is obtained by passing to the Kolmogorov quotient.

One way to prove it is to show that a uniformity on a set is induced by a pseudometric if it has a countable base.  And if a topological group is first countable, the usual left (or right) uniformity on the group has a countable base.

See Theorem 38.3 and Problem 38C(1) in {{zb:1052.54001}}, or Theorem 8.1.21 and Exercise 8.1.G in {{zb:0684.54001}}.
