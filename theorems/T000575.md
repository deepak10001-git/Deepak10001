  name: Almost discrete SV-spaces (Henrikson, Wilson)
---
First, any almost discrete space is {P13}: if $A$ and $B$ are disjoint closed sets, then at least one of them, say $A$, does not contain the nonisolated point. Then $A$ is clopen, and thus $A$ and $B$ are separated by open sets.

A subspace of an almost discrete space is either almost discrete or discrete and so is also normal. Hence any almost discrete space is completely normal.

See lemma 2.1(i) of {{doi:10.1016/0166-8641(92)90123-H}}.
