  name: Almost discrete SV-spaces (Henrikson, Wilson)
---
First, any almost discrete space $X$ is {P13}: if $A$ and $B$ are disjoint closed sets, then at least one of them, say $A$, does not contain the nonisolated point. Then $A$ is clopen, and thus $A$ and $B$ are separated by open sets.

Note also {T574}. {P146}, of course, implies {P30}. Thus, by {T453}, $X$ is fully normal,
which in turn implies it is {P88}. (See {T214} and {T648}.)

A subspace of an almost discrete space is either almost discrete or discrete and so is always {P88} [(Explore)](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces?q=Discrete+%2B+not+Collectionwise+normal). Hence any almost discrete space is {P108}.
