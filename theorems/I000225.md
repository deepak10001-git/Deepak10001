Let $\mathcal U$ be an open cover of $X$.

Let $\mathcal V$ be the collection of all finite unions of members of $\mathcal U$. Then $\mathcal V$ is an open  $k$-cover of $X$. Since $X$ is $k$-Lindelöf there exists a countable subfamily of $\mathcal V$ which is still a $k$-cover of $X$. Since points are compact this is in particular an open cover of $X$.

All open sets in $\mathcal U$ which are used for the unions in the countable subcover of $\mathcal V$ form the desired countable subcover of $X$. Hence, $X$ is Lindelöf.
