Let $S$ be a countable dense set in the totally ordered space $X$. Then the collection of open intervals $(a,b)$ where $a<b\in S$ together with open rays $(-\infty, a)$ and $(a, \infty)$ where $a\in S$ forms a base for $X$.

Since $S$ is countable and totally ordered, there is an order-preserving function $f:S\to \mathbb{Q}\cap (0,1)$. Since $X$ is second countable, it is first countable and therefore FrÃ©chet Urysohn. Thus $f$ can be extended to $F:X\to [0,1]$. Since $X$ is $T_2$ the extension is unique. Define $d:X\times X \to \mathbb{R}$ by $d(x, y) = d(F(x), F(y))$.
