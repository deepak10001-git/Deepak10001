See Proposition 11.4 in [C. Rezk, "Compactly generated spaces"](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/Rezk_CompactlyGeneratedSpaces.pdf)
or Proposition 2.14 in [N. Strickland, "The category of CGWH spaces"](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/StricklandCGHWSpaces.pdf).

(also mentioned implicitly as an equivalent definition of CGWH in {{mo:455457}})
