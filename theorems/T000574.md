Let $p$ be the non-isolated point. Then the closure of any open singleton $\{x\}$ is either $\{x\}$ or $\{x,p\}$, the interior of which must be $\{x\}$ since $p$ is not isolated and $\{x,p\}$ cannot be the entire space. Additionally, any neighborhood of the isolated point is closed.Thus, the neighborhood filter of $p$ along with the isolated singletons is such a basis.
