  name: Almost discrete SV-spaces (Henrikson, Wilson)
---
First, any almost discrete space is {P13}: if $A$ and $B$ are disjoint closed sets, then at most one of them, say $A$, does not contain the nonisolated point. Then $X\setminus A$ is a clopen set containing $B$, so $A$ and $B$ are separated by open sets.

Any subspace of an almost discrete space is either almost discrete or discrete and so is also normal, hence any almost discrete space is completely normal.

See lemma 2.1(i) of {{doi:10.1016/0166-8641(92)90123-H}}.
