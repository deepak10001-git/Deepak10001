## Welcome to the π-Base Codespace!

### Editing and refreshing

A window should automatically open with a preview of the data
repository. If it is closed, you can re-open it by ctrl/cmd-clicking
this link: <http://localhost:5173>.

Making changes to file in your codespace should trigger an automatic rebuild and
reload of the viewer.

### More information

Visit the [π-Base wiki](https://github.com/pi-base/data/wiki)
to learn more about how to use this Codespace to contribute to the
`pi-base/data` repository.

### Troubleshooting

#### Data changes not visible

First, ensure that your changes compiled without error by examining the output
in the `Terminal` > `Codespaces: compile` process. A red `Build failed` should
include validation messages with instructions about errors to correct.

Successful `Build finished` messages should automatically trigger a reload of
the preview viewer. To manually refresh your preview – or to inspect the status
of its loaded data any time – visit the `Advanced` or branch tab
of the viewer app at <http://localhost:5173/dev>. Click the refresh (⟳)
icon next to "Sync" to reload the data with your updates.
