Let $f:X \rightarrow X$ be a continuous selfmap and $p \in X$ be the excluded point.
If $f$ is a constant function then it has a fixed point.
Otherwise, it must be that $f(p) = p$, as if were not, then $X\setminus {f(p)}$ would be closed
yet $f^{-1}(X\setminus {f(p)}) \not\ni p$ would not be, making $f$ not continuous.
