  name: Is the line with multiple origins locally compact?
---

The closure of any neighborhood $U$ of any of the origins contains all the other origins.  That closure $\overline U$ cannot be compact, as the set of all origins is infinite, closed and discrete.  So the origin points don't have closed compact neighborhoods.
