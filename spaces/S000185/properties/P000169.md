Every pair of points besides $\infty_x,\infty_y$ may be separated by disjoint
open sets, and therefore have regular open sets that contain each while missing
the other.

Then $(\omega\setminus 1)\times\omega\cup\{\infty_x\}$ is a regular open
neighborhood of $\infty_x$ missing $\infty_y$, and
$\omega\times(\omega\setminus 1)\cup\{\infty_y\}$ is a regular open
neighborhood of $\infty_y$ missing $\infty_x$, and
