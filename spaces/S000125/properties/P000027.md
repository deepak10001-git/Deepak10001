This has the subspace topology of $\mathbb{R}^2$. The subspace of a second countable space is second countable.
In this case, from any countable basis $B$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$, we can make the basis of the leaky tent $\mathscr{T}$, as such, $B_\mathscr{T}=\{U \cap X |U \in B \: \& \: X \in \mathscr{T}\}$.
