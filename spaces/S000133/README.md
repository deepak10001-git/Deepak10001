Fix any $n$ and take $\mathbb{R}$ as our set of points. Take as the basic
open sets all singletons $\{x\}$ for $x\not= 0$, and the usual (in the sense of
{S25}) neighborhoods of $0$.

As shown in {{mathse:4834226}},
this construction is equivalent to the post office metric space defined as
counterexample #139 ("The Post Office Metric")
in {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}}:
If $d$ is the usual metric on $\mathbb{R}^2$, the post office metric $p$ is defined by:

$r(x,y) = \begin{cases}
    0 & x=y \\
    d(x,(0,0)) + d(y,(0,0)) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$

Note that {{mathse:4834226}} shows furthermore that a corresponding construction
for any $\mathbb R^n$ (for $n>0$) results in a copy of this space.
