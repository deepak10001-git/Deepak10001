Let $X=\mathbb{R}$ with basic open neighborhoods of $0$ being the Euclidean open intervals around $0$ and all points $x\ne 0$ isolated.

As shown in {{mathse:4834226}},
this construction is equivalent to the post office metric space defined as
counterexample #139 ("The Post Office Metric")
in {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}}.
If $d$ is the usual metric on $\mathbb{R}$, the *post office metric* $p$ is defined by:

$p(x,y) = \begin{cases}
    0 & \text{if } x=y, \\
    d(x,0) + d(y,0) & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}$

Note that {{mathse:4834226}} shows furthermore that the corresponding construction
for any $\mathbb R^n$ (for $n>0$) results in a space homeomorphic to this one.
