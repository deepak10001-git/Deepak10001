A space $X$ with a particular point $p$ satisfying:

- Each point of $X\setminus\{p\}$ is isolated.
- There exist neighborhoods $V_n$ of $p$ for each $n<\omega$ such that $V_{n+1}\subseteq V_{n}$, $\{p\}=\bigcap_{n<\omega} V_n$, and $|V_{n+1}\setminus V_n|=|\mathbb R|$.

The following sufficient constructions were demonstrated in
{{mathse:4834226}}.

- Let $X=\mathbb{R}$ with $p=0$. The basic open neighborhoods of $0$ are the Euclidean open intervals around $0$.

- The post office metric space defined as
counterexample #139 ("The Post Office Metric")
in {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}}, where $p$ is the origin.
The *post office metric* $p$ on $\mathbb R^n$ is then defined by:

$$d(x,y) = \begin{cases}
    0 & \text{if } x=y, \\
    \|x\| + \|y\| & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}$$

- $(\mathbb R\times\mathbb Z)\cup\{\infty\}$ where $\mathbb R\times\mathbb Z$ has its lexicographical ordering, and $\infty$ is the greatest (and particular) point.
