The particular point $0$ does not have a compact neighborhood.  Indeed, let $U$ be a neighborhood of $0$.  Then there is  $B(0,\varepsilon)\subseteq U$.  The collection $\mathcal{A} = \{\{x\}: x\in U\setminus B(0,\varepsilon/2)\}\cup \{B(0,\varepsilon/2)\}$ is an open covering of $U$ with infinitely many elements and no proper subcover.
