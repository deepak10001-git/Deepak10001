The particular point does not have a compact neighborhood.  Indeed, let $N$ be a neighborhood of $0$.  Then there is  $V_n\subseteq N$.  The collection $\mathcal{A} = \{\{x\}: x\in N\setminus V_{n+1}\}\cup \{V_{n+1}\}$ is an open covering of $N$ with infinitely many elements and no proper subcover.
