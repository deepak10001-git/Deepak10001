Suppose that $\langle x_n \rangle$ is a Cauchy sequence that does not converge to $(0,0)$.  Then there is $\varepsilon>0$ and a subsequence $x_{n_i}$ such that $d(x_{n_i},(0,0))\ge \varepsilon$.  Let $N$ be an index such that $d(x_n,x_m)<\varepsilon$ for all $n,m\ge N$.  Let $n_i$ be the first element of the subsequence with $n_i\ge N$ and let $n\ge N$ be arbitrary. We have $d(x_n,(0,0))+d(x_{n_i},(0,0))\ge \varepsilon$, and therefore we must conclude that $x_{n}=x_{n_i}$, hence $\langle x_n \rangle$ is eventually constant and therefore convergent.
