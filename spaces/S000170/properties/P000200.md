Consider the map $p: \mathbb{R} \longrightarrow S^1$ from the real line {S000025} to {S000170} given by $x \mapstol (cos(x),sin(x))$. This is now a covering map, since for each $x\in S^1$ and for every open neighboorhood $U\not= S^1$ we have that its preimage under $p$ is homeomorphic to countably many copies o the neighboorhood.
Furthermore $\gamma: [0,1] \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ $x \mapsto 2\pi x$ is a path in {S000025} such that $p\circ\gamma$ is a loop in $S^1$. Now $p\circ\gamma$ is not homotopic to the constant path since otherwise we could lift a homotopy to {S000025} which contradicts the fact, that $\gamma$ is not a loop.
