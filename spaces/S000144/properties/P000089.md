Note that in $X$, $x \leq y$ iff $x \in \overline{\{y\}}$, i.e., $\leq$ corresponds to the specialization preorder. Now, let $f: X\to X$ be continuous, then we have $x \leq y$ implies $f(x) \leq f(y)$. Hence, if neither $0$ nor $1$ are fixed points, the range of $f$ must be $\{a\}$ or $\{b\}$, making either $a$ or $b$ a fixed point.
