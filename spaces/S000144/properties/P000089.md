Let $f: X \to X$ be continuous. Note that any maximal element of the range is open in the range, so if the range has multiple maximal elements, the inverse images of those maximal elements would be nonempty disjoint open subsets of $X$, which is impossible as {S144|P39}. Thus, the range has a single maximum. The inverse image of the maximum is nonempty open, and all nonempty open sets in $X$ contain $1$, so $f(1)$ is the maximum of the range. If the maximum is $1$, then $1$ is a fixed point.

Dually, we may similarly show that the range has a minimum, namely $f(0)$, so if the minimum is $0$, then $0$ is a fixed point.

Finally, if the maximum of the range is not $1$ and the minimum of the range is not $0$, then as maximum and minimum of the range both exist, the only choices for the range are $\{a\}$ and $\{b\}$, so either $a$ or $b$, respectively, is a fixed point.
