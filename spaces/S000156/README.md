Let \(X=\omega\cup\{\infty\}\) be the one-point compactification of a
countable discrete space. Arens space \(S_2\) is the minimal topology
on \((X\times\omega)\cup\{\infty'\}\) where
\((\{\infty\}\times\omega)\cup\{\infty'\}\) is homeomorphic to \(X\).

This space was originally defined by Richard Arens in {{mr:MR0037500}}.
