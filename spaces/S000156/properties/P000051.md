  name: What separation properties are satisfied by the Arens space?
---

Let $A$ be a nonempty subset of the Arens space $Y$.  Either $A$ contains a point isolated in $Y$, or $A$ is contained in a subspace of $Y$ homeomorphic to {S20} which is {P51}.  In both cases $A$ contains a point isolated in $A$.
