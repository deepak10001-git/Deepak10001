  name: What kinds of selection principles hold for Fortissimo space?
---

As the space $Y=[0,\omega_1]$ is some type of Fortissimo space, it is {P151} as shown in {{mathse:4727833}}.

The space $X=Y\times [0,\omega]$ is a countable union of copies of $Y$ (the horizontal slices), and a countable union of {P151} subspaces is {P151} (by a suitable parallel meshing of the strategies for the various subspaces).
