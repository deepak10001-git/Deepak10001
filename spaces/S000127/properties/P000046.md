Let $\alpha$ be a continuous function from $[0,1]$ to $X$. If $\alpha(0) \ne \alpha(1)$ then since $X$ is Hausdorff we may assume without loss of generality that $\alpha$ is injective. But then $\alpha([0,1]) = \alpha([0, 1/2]) \cup \alpha([1/2, 1])$, contradicting the fact that $X$ is hereditarily indecomposable. Thus $\alpha$ must be constant.
