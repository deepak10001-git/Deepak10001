Let $F : [0, 1] \times [0, 1] \to [0, 1]$ denote the homotopy $(x, t) \mapsto (1 - t) x$ from the identity to the constant $0$ map. Obtain a homotopy $G : [0, 1] \times ([0, 1] \sqcup [0, 1]) \to [0, 1] \sqcup [0, 1]$ by composing $F \sqcup F$ with the available canonical map. Let $q : [0, 1] \sqcup [0, 1] \to X$ denote the quotient map that defines $X$. Since $q \circ G$ is constant on the fibers of $q \times \mathrm{Id}_{[0, 1]}$, it follows that $q \circ G$ descends to a continuous map $[0, 1] \times X \to X$. This is a homotopy from the identity to the constant $0$ map because $F$ is.
