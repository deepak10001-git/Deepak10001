Consider an uncountable index set $I$ and the product $\mathbb R^I$ with the product topology, i.e. the space of all functions from $I$ to $\mathbb R$ with the topology of pointwise convergence. The Sigma Product is defined to be the subspace of all functions which vanish outside of a countable set, i.e. they have countable support (when $I$ is endowed with the discrete topology). As a subspace of $\mathbb R^I$, the Sigma Product also carries the topology of pointwise convergence.
