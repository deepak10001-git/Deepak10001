The identity function $\text{Id}:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$, $\text{Id}(x) = x$ from {S57} to {S25} is a continuous bijection. Since every subspace of {S25} is realcompact ({S25} is hereditarily Lindelof, and $T_{3.5}$ Lindelof space is realcompact), {S57} is realcompact from corollary 8.18 in {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4615-7819-2}}.
