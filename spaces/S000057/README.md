For each irrational $x \in \mathbb{R}$ fix a sequence of rational numbers $x_i \rightarrow x$. The rational sequence topology on $\mathbb{R}$ is defined by declaring each rational point open and letting $U_n(x) = \{x_i : i>n\} \cup \{x\}$ be a local basis at each irrational $x$.

Note that specifying the terms $x_i$ beyond convergence to $x$ was shown in {{mo:447593}} to be necessary to characterize a unique topology, but none of the properties currently tracked for this space rely on this information.
