For each irrational $x \in \mathbb{R}$ fix the sequence of rational numbers $x_i \rightarrow x$ where $x_i$ is the truncation of $x$ to $i$ decimal places. (Whether specifying the terms of this sequence beyond convergence to $x$ affects the topology is an open question {{mo:447593}}.) The rational sequence topology on $\mathbb{R}$ is defined by declaring each rational point open and letting $U_n(x) = \{x_i : i>n\} \cup \{x\}$ be a local basis at each irrational $x$.
