Let $p$ and $q$ be distinct points belonging to the same $L(c)$. We will suppose $c \in \mathcal{E}$ (the proof is similar for $c \in \mathcal{F}$).

Let $U_p$ and $U_q$ be open sets in the usual topology on $\mathbb{R}^2$ containing $p$ and $q$, respectively, whose union contains the entire teepee. Since $p$ and $q$ both belong to the segment $L(c)$, the boundary of the open set $U_p$ (denoted $\delta U_p$) must intersect $L(c)$, so there is a real number $t \in \mathcal{C}$ such that $\delta U_p \cap L(t) \cap X$ is nonempty. Let $r$ be a point belonging to this intersection. Since $X \subset U_p \cup U_q$ and $r \notin U_p$, it follows that $r \in U_q$. Therefore, $r \in \overline{U_p} \cap U_q$, which means $U_p$ and $U_q$ are not separated sets.
