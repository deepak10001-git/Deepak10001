$X$ is closed, hyperconnected and $p$ is a generic point in $X$. Let $C$ be a proper non-empty closed subset of $X$, $C$ is a subset of $X \setminus \\{p\\}$, which is a discrete subspace, hence totally disconnected. Therefore, $C$ is hyperconnected if and only if $C$ is a singleton. It follows that $X$ is quasi-sober.
