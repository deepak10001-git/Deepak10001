If $V\subseteq X$ is open and non-empty, then $\overline{V} = X$ since $0\in V$ and $X$ is the only closed set containing $0$.

Therefore if $H = \{1\}$ and $U = \{0, 1\}$ then $H$ is closed and countable, $U$ is open, but there is no open $V$ such that $H\subseteq V\subseteq \overline{V}\subseteq U$.
