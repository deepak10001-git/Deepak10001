By example 7 of {{doi:10.1016/s0924-6509(08)x7010-2}} {S136} is shrinking (e.g. corollary 6 in <https://dantopology.wordpress.com/2016/12/08/countably-paracompact-spaces/>), hence countably paracompact. Also see <https://dantopology.wordpress.com/2012/11/18/bings-example-g/> for another proof that {S136} is countably paracompact.
