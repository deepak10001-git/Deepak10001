Suppose $\mathcal{U}_n$ is a locally finite collection. If $p$ is the excluded point, then any open set around $p$ must be the entire space $X$ and so meets every member of $\mathcal{U}_n$. Thus $\mathcal{U}_n$ must be finite. But each $\{x\}$ for $x \neq p$ is open and so if $\mathcal{U} = \cup \mathcal{U}_n$ is a basis, some $\mathcal{U}_n$ must contain uncountably many singletons.
