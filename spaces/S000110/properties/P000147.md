Let $\mathcal{U}$ be a free ultrafilter on $\omega$.  Since the ultrafilter is free, for each $n\in\omega$ there exists $A_n\in\mathcal{U}$ not containing $n$.  The intersection of all the $A_n$ is empty.  Then $\bigcap_{n\in\omega} (A_n\cup \{\mathcal{U}\}) = \{\mathcal{U}\}$ is a countable intersection of open sets, but is not open.
