    name: Show that the product topology on $X\times Y$ is the same as the disjoint union topology on $\bigsqcup_{y\in Y}X$.

Let $I$ denote {S3}. By {{mathse:2726886}}, 
$$X \approx \bigsqcup_{i \in I} \mathbb{Q} \approx I \times \mathbb{Q}.$$
Since {S3|P87}, {S27|P87}, and a product of topological groups is a topological group, it follows that $X$ has a group topology.
