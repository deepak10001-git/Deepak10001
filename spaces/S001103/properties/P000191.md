Per definition of product topology, it is easy to see that any nonempty $G_\delta$ set must contain a subset of the form $Y \times \omega^{2^{\mathfrak{c}} \setminus I}$ where $I \subset 2^{\mathfrak{c}}$ is countable and $Y \subset \omega^I$ is nonempty. In particular, no $G_\delta$ set is a singleton.
