Let $X$ be the space $\ell^2$ of all sequences $x = \langle x_i \rangle$ of real numbers such that $\Sigma x_i^2$ converges, with topology generated by the metric $d(x,y) = \sqrt{\Sigma(x_i - y_i)^2}$.  Any separable Hilbert space is isomorphic to $\ell^2$.

This space is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ with the product topology (Fréchet space).  For this deep result due to R. D. Anderson, see for example {{doi:10.1090/S0002-9904-1968-12044-0}}.

More generally, any infinite-dimensional separable Banach space or, even more generally, any infinite-dimensional separable Fréchet space is homeomorphic to $\mathbb R^\omega$.  See {{wikipedia:Anderson–Kadec theorem}}.

In particular, the following are all homeomorphic as topological spaces:
- $\mathbb R^\omega$
- Sequence spaces $\ell^p$ ($1 \leq p < + \infty$)
- Spaces $L^p([0,1])$ ($1 \leq p < + \infty$) of Lebesgue measurable functions with finite $L^p$-norm
- The Banach space $C([0,1])$ of real-valued continuous functions on $[0,1]$ with the supremum norm

Moreover, by Theorem VI.2.1, Corollary VI.2.2, and Theorem VI.5.1 of {{mr:0478168}} and Corollary 9.3 of {{doi:10.1090/S0002-9904-1968-12044-0}}, the following are also homeomorphic to $\mathbb R^\omega$:
- The closed upper half-space of $\ell^2$, i.e., $\{\langle x_i \rangle \in \ell^2: x_1 \geq 0\}$, given the subspace topology
- The subspace of $\ell^2$ consisting of all elements with infinitely many nonzero entries, i.e., $\{\langle x_i \rangle \in \ell^2: x_i \neq 0 \text{ for infinitely many } i\}$, given the subspace topology
- The cone over $\mathbb R^\omega$, i.e., the quotient of $\mathbb R^\omega \times [0, 1]$ with $\mathbb R^\omega \times \{0\}$ identified to a single point
- The open cone over $\mathbb R^\omega$, i.e., the quotient of $\mathbb R^\omega \times [0, \infty)$ with $\mathbb R^\omega \times \{0\}$ identified to a single point
- The closed unit ball of any infinite-dimensional separable Banach space, i.e., $\{x \in E: \|x\| \leq 1\}$ where $E$ is an infinite-dimensional separable Banach space under the norm $\|\cdot\|$, given the topology generated by the metric $d(x,y) = \|x-y\|$
- The unit sphere of any infinite-dimensional separable Banach space, i.e., $\{x \in E: \|x\| = 1\}$ where $E$ is an infinite-dimensional separable Banach space under the norm $\|\cdot\|$, given the topology generated by the metric $d(x,y) = \|x-y\|$

Specific instances of the above are counterexamples #36 ("Hilbert Space"), #37 ("Fréchet Space"), and #108 ("$C[0,1]$")  in {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}}.
