Use $f_\alpha:\alpha\to\omega$ such that $f_\alpha$ agrees with $f_\beta$ on their common domains for all but finitely many ordinals, and for each open cover fix $\alpha$ such that $\omega_1^\dagger\setminus\alpha$ is contained in some open set. Then, during each round, cover $\omega_1^\dagger\setminus\alpha$, $f_\alpha^{-1}[n]$, and the finite ordinals less than $\alpha$ for which the value of $f_\alpha$ has changed from the second-most recent cover to the most recent cover.
