No point has a closed compact neighborhood.  Indeed, let $U$ be a neighborhood of some point.  The set $U$ contains a non-trivial interval $I=[a,b]\times\{0\}\subseteq A$.  The closure $\overline I=[a,b]\times\{0,1\}$ is not compact because it contains $[a,b]\times\{1\}$, which is infinite, discrete and closed in $X$.  So the closure of $U$ is not compact.
