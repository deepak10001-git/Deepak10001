This space is similar to {S83}, with every point "doubled".

The space can be described as the union of two real lines $X=A\sqcup B$ with $A = \mathbb R\times\{0\}$ and $B=\mathbb R\times\{1\}$.  A set $U\subseteq X$ is open exactly when $U\cap A$ is open in $A$ with the usual Euclidean topology and for each $x=(r,1)\in U\cap B$, the set $U$ contains a deleted neighborhood of $(r,0)$ in $A$.

Equivalently, this space has the topology on $X= \mathbb R\times\{0,1\}$ generated by the basic open sets
$B(\langle x,i\rangle,\epsilon)=\{\langle x,i\rangle\}\cup\Big(\Big((x-\epsilon,x)\cup(x,x+\epsilon)\Big)\times\{0\}\Big)$
for each point $\langle x,i\rangle\in X$ and $\epsilon>0$.

See section 3 of {{doi:10.1090/S0002-9939-07-09100-9}}
and the description of the general construction in {{mathse:3678440}}.

This provides an example of a {P123} space that is not {P3}, but is {P86}.
