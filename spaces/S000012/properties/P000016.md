To show that the Countable Excluded Point Topology is compact, we must show that given any open covering $\mathscr{A}$ of $X$ there exists a finite subcollection of $\mathscr{A}$ that also covers $X$. To begin, let $\mathscr{A}$ be an open covering of $X$. From this, it can easily be concluded that $p$ is an element of some open set within the open covering $\mathscr{A}$. Because the only open set containing $p$ is $X$, it follows $X \in \mathscr{A}$. Note that the set containing $X$ is a finite covering of $X$. So, the Countable Excluded Point Topology is compact.
