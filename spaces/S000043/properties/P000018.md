If $\{U_\alpha\}$ is an open cover of $X$, consider the Euclidean interiors $U = \cup int(U_\alpha)$. For each $x \notin U$, $x \in [x,a_x) \subset U_\alpha$ for some $a_x \in X$. Thus $(x,a_x) \subset int(U_\alpha)$ and since the intervals $(x,a_x)$ are pairwise disjoint and $\mathbb{R}$ is ccc, $X \setminus U$ is at most countable and may be covered by countably many $U_\alpha$. But $U \subset \mathbb{R}$ is Lindelof and so may also be covered by countably many $int(U_\alpha)$.
