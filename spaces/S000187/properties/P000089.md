Let $f:X\to X$ be continuous.

If $2$ is in the range of $f$, then
$f^\leftarrow[\{2\}]$ is non-empty and open, and thus contains $2$.

If $2$ is not in the range of $f$, then consider
$f\upharpoonright\{0,1\}$, where $\{0,1\}$ is the subspace {S10}.
Then $f\upharpoonright\{0,1\}$ has a fixed point as {S10|P89}.
