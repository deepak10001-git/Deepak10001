The space $X$ contains as a subspace a copy of a "Fortissimo" space $W=[0,\omega_1]$ (with neighborhoods of $\omega_1$ cocountable and all other points isolated).  The point $\omega_1\in W$ is in the closure of $[0,\omega_1)$, but every countable subset of $[0,\omega_1)$ is closed in $W$.  So $W$ is not {P81}, and neither is $X$ since {P81} is a hereditary property.
