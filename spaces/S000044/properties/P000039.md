Given that $U_n$ denotes sets in the nested interval topology we can see that
\begin{align*}
U_n \subset U_{n+1}
\end{align*}
for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Therefore for any two sets in the Nested Interval Topology one is a subset of the other which implies there are no disjoint open sets thus the Nested Interval Topology is Hyper-connected.
