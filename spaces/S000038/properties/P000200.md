For any distinct $p, q \in X$, $[p,q]$ is homeomorphic to $[0,1] \subset \mathbb{R}$. See item #6 for space #45 in {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9_6}}. It follows that $X$ is path connected.

Let $F : S^1 \to X$ be a continuous map. The image of $F$ is compact and connected, since $S^1$ is. The compact and connected sets in $X$ are either homeomorphic to {S162} or to {S158}, both of which are contractible. Since every continuous map to a contractible space is homotopic to a constant map, it follows that $F$ is in particular.
