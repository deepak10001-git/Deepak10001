Let $X$ be the ordered space $\omega_1+1+\omega^*$ with the corresponding order topology.  Here $+$ is concatenation, $\omega_1$ is {S35}, $1$ is the singleton $\{p\}$ for some point $p$, and $\omega^*$ is $\omega$ with the reverse order.

This provides an example of a {P133} space that is not {P174}.
