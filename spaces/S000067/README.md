Let $X = \{(x,y) : x,y \in \mathbb{Q}, y \geq 0\}$. For a fixed irrational $\theta$, the irrational slope topology on $X$ is defined by letting $N_\epsilon(x,y) = \{(x,y)\} \cup B(x - y/\theta, \epsilon) \cup B(x + y/\theta, \epsilon)$ where $B(a, \epsilon)$ is an interval on the $x$-axis centered at $a$ with radius $\epsilon$.  That is, $N_\epsilon(x,y)$ consists of the point $(x,y)$ together with the rational numbers in an $\epsilon$-neighborhood around the two points where the lines passing through $(x,y)$ with slopes $\theta$ and $-\theta$ cross the real $x$-axis.
