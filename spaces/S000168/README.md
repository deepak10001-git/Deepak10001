The quotient of a {S169} $S^2$ identifying its antipodal points.

Equivalently, the quotient of $[0,1]^2$ identifying $\langle t,0\rangle$ with $\langle 1-t,1\rangle$ and identifying $\langle 0,t\rangle$ with $\langle 1,1-t\rangle$.

This space is homeomorphic to:
- $\left( \mathbb R^3 \setminus \{0\} \right) / \sim$, where $x \sim y$ if and only if $x = c y$ for some nonzero real number $c$,
- The quotient of $\left[ -1, 1 \right]^2$ identifying $(t, 1)$ with $(-t, -1)$ and identifying $(1, t)$ with $(-1, -t)$.
