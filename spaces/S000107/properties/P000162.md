The identity function $\text{Id}:\mathbb{R}^\omega\to \mathbb{R}^\omega$, $\text{Id}(x) = x$ from {S107} to $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ with product topology is a continuous bijection. Since every subspace of $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ with product topology is realcompact ($\mathbb{R}^\omega$ is {P5} and {P131}, and see {T384}), {S107} is realcompact from corollary 8.18 in {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4615-7819-2}}.
