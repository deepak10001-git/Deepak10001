The set \(\mathbb{R}^\omega\) with the box product topology where basic open
sets are of the form \(\Prod_{i<\omega}U_i\) for \(U_i\) open in \(\mathbb R\).
Also known as the Boolean product.

Defined as counterexample #109 ("Box Product Topology on \(\mathbb{R}^\omega\)")
in {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}}.
