Any open cover of $X$ must contain the set $X$ itself. Thus $X$ is fully normal trivially.

The General Reference Chart asserts this fact for the
Excluded Point spaces #13-#15 in
{{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9_6}}, where fully normal is denoted fully
\(T_4\) and vice versa. Note that the Sierpinski space is an Excluded Point
space with two points.

The chart in *Counterexamples* erroneously marks the Sierpinski Space
itself as not fully normal because it is lumped in with the other
Particular Point topologies, but Particular Point topologies require
three or more points to break this property.
