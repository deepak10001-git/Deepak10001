Note that as the Indiscrete Rational Extension topology on $\mathbb{R}$ is finer than the usual topology on $\mathbb{R}$, it follows that every compact subset must be closed as a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ with the usual topology. Furthermore, it can be shown that no nondegenerate closed interval $[a,b]$ is a compact subset of this space.

* For example, the following open cover of $[0,1]$ has no finite subcover: $\{ (-1,2) \cap D \} \cup \{ ( 0 , 1 - \tfrac{1}{n} ) : n=2,3,\ldots \}.$

Therefore the compact subsets are nowhere dense with respect to the usual topology on $\mathbb{R}$, and the [Baire Category Theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baire_category_theorem) then implies that the Indiscrete Rational Extension of $\mathbb{R}$ cannot be $\sigma$-compact.
