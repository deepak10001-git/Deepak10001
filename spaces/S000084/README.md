This space is similar to {S83}, but with a countably infinite number of origins.
Given $S$ a countably infinite set with the discrete topology, the space can be constructed as a quotient space of $\mathbb R \times S$ by identifying points $(x,\alpha)$ and $(x,\beta)$ whenever $x\ne 0$.

Equivalently, it can be obtained from $\mathbb R$ by replacing the origin $0$ with many origins $0_\alpha$, one for each $\alpha \in S$.  The subspace $\mathbb R\setminus\{0\}$ retains its Euclidean topology. Basic open neighborhoods of each origin $0_\alpha$ are of the form $(U\setminus \{0\})\cup \{0_\alpha\}$ with $U$ an open neighborhood of $0$ in $\mathbb R$.
