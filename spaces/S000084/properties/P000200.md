Let $\{0_i\}_{i = 0}^\infty$ denote the indexed set of origins, with $0_0 := 0 \in \mathbb{R}$. Let $A := \mathbb{R} \cup \{0_1\} \subset X$, and note that $A$ is homeomorphic to {S83} by definition. Define the map $r : X \to X$ by $r|_A := \mathrm{Id}_A$ and $r(0_i) := 0_0$ for $i \ge 2$. It is straightforward to check that $r$ is continuous at each origin, and since $r|_{\mathbb{R} \backslash \{0\}}$ is the identity map, it follows that $r$ is continuous. Moreover, $r|_A = \mathrm{Id}_A$ implies that $r$ is a retraction onto $A$. Since $\pi_1(A) \neq 0$, as {S83|P37} but {S83|P200}, it follows by Proposition 1.17 of {{zb:1044.55001}} that $\pi_1(X)$ is non-trivial.
