The set $(X\times Y)\setminus\{\langle\omega_1,\omega\rangle\}$ 
where $X=[0,\omega_1]$ is given the topology with points of $[0,\omega_1)$
isolated, and neighborhoods of $\omega_1$ are cocountable,
and $Y=[0,\omega]$ is given the topology with points of $[0,\omega)$
isolated, and neighborhoods of $\omega$ are cofinite.

Defined as counterexample #89 ("Dieudonné Plank")
in {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}}. Note that the pi-Base qualifies this name with
"Deleted" to align with e.g. {S78} and {S79}; compare with {S187}.
