  name: What are the compactness properties of $\mathbb R$, extended by a point with co-countable open neighborhoods?
---

Let $X=\mathbb R\cup \{\infty\}$, with $\mathbb R$ having the Euclidean topology and open in $X$, and open neighborhoods of $\infty$ given by sets of the form $U\cup\{\infty\}$, where $U\subseteq \mathbb R$ is co-countable and open in the Euclidean topology. 

Constructed in {{mathse:4850979}} as an example of a space that is {P173} and {P81}, yet fails to be {P79}, yielding a counterexample to a natural analogue of {T211}.  Elaborated on in {{mathse:4854178}}.
