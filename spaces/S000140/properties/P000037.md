If $\gamma\colon [0,1]\to X$ is a path joining any point in $\mathbb R$ to $\infty$, and WLOG $\gamma^{-1}(\{\infty\})=\{1\}$, then $\gamma(1-\frac{1}{n})$ is a sequence in $\mathbb R$ converging to $\infty$, contradicting that $\mathbb R$ is sequentially closed in $X$, as explained in {{mathse:4850979}}.
