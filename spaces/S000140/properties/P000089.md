If $\gamma\colon [0,1]\to X$ is a path joining any point in $\mathbb R$ to $\infty$, and WLOG $\gamma^{-1}(\{\infty\})=\{1\}$, then $\gamma(1-\frac{1}{n})$ is a sequence in $\mathbb R$ converging to $\infty$, contradicting that $\mathbb R$ is sequentially closed in $X$, as explained in {{mathse:4850979}}.  Therefore $\infty$ cannot be joined by a path to any other point.

Thus if $f\colon X\to X$ is continuous, then either $f(\mathbb R)=\{\infty\}$, whereby $f(\infty)$ must equal $\infty$ in order for $f(X)$ to be connected, or $f(\mathbb R)\subseteq \mathbb R$.  In the latter case, we either again have $f(\infty)=\infty$, or we have $f(X)\subseteq \mathbb R$, which implies (since $X$ is {P60}), that $f$ is constant.

We conclude that either $\infty$ is a fixed point, or $f$ is a constant map $f\equiv p$, so that $p$ is a fixed point.
