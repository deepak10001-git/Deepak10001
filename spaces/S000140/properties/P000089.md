As explained [here](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces/S000140/properties/P000037), $\infty$ cannot be joined by a path to any other point.

Thus if $f\colon X\to X$ is continuous, then either $f(\mathbb R)=\{\infty\}$, whereby $f(\infty)$ must equal $\infty$ in order for $f(X)$ to be connected, or $f(\mathbb R)\subseteq \mathbb R$.  In the latter case, we either again have $f(\infty)=\infty$, or we have $f(X)\subseteq \mathbb R$, which implies (since $X$ is {P60}) that $f$ is constant.

We conclude that either $\infty$ is a fixed point, or $f$ is a constant map $f\equiv p$, so that $p$ is a fixed point.
