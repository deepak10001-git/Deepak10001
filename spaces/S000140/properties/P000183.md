  name: What are the compactness properties of $\mathbb{R}$, extended by a point with co-countable open neighborhoods?
---

A subset $K$ of $X$ is compact if and only if $K \cap \mathbb{R}$ is compact in the Euclidean topology on $\mathbb{R}$ (see {{mathse:4854178}}).

Let $\mathcal{N}$ be a countable $k$-network of $\mathbb{R}$ with the Euclidean topology, $\mathcal{N} \cup \{\infty\}$ is a countable $k$-network of $X$.
