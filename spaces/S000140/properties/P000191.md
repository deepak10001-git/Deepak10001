$\{\infty\}$ is a countable intersection of open sets if, and only if, $\mathbb{R}$ is a countable union of closed sets. Let $C \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be a closed set in $X$. As, $X \setminus C$ is an open neighborhood of $\{\infty\}$ in $X$, then $C$ is countable. A countable union of countable sets is countable. As, $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable, then it is not a countable union of closed sets.
