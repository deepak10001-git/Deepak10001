Let $r\colon X\to A$ be a retraction.  If $r$ is constant, its image is closed, since singletons in $X$ are closed.  Suppose then that $r$ is not constant. Since $X$ is {P60},  $A$ must contain $\infty$.  

Moreover,  $\infty$ cannot be joined by a path to any other point, as explained [here](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces/S000140/properties/P000037), so by continuity of $r$, we cannot have $\infty\in r(\mathbb R)$, as otherwise we would have $r(\mathbb R)=\{\infty\}$, contradicting that $r$ is not constant.

Therefore $r(\mathbb R)\subseteq \mathbb R$, so $r$ restricts to a retraction of $\mathbb R$.  Then $A\cap \mathbb R$ is closed in $\mathbb R$, since the {S25} {P101}.  As $\infty\in A$, $A$ is closed in $X$.
