If $r\colon X\to A$ is a retraction, and $r$ is not constant, then since $X$ is {P60},  $A$ must contain $\infty$.  

Moreover, if $\gamma\colon [0,1]\to X$ is a path joining any point in $\mathbb R$ to $\infty$, and WLOG $\gamma^{-1}(\{\infty\})=\{1\}$, then $\gamma(1-\frac{1}{n})$ is a sequence in $\mathbb R$ converging to $\infty$, contradicting that $\mathbb R$ is sequentially closed in $X$, as explained in {{mathse:4850979}}.  Therefore $\infty$ cannot be joined by a path to any other point, so either $r(\mathbb R)=\{\infty\}$ so that $r$ is constant, or $r(\mathbb R)\subseteq \mathbb R$.  In the latter case, $r$ restricts to a retraction of $\mathbb R$, so that $A\cap \mathbb R$ is closed in $\mathbb R$, since the {S25} {P101}.  Then since $\infty\in A$, $A$ is closed in $X$.

If $r$ is constant, its image is closed, since singletons in $X$ are closed.
