Let $f\colon X\to \mathbb R$, with $f(\infty)=p$.  Then for each $n\in \mathbb N$, $f^{-1}((p-\frac{1}{n},p+\frac{1}{n}))$ contains a neighborhood of $\infty$, hence is cocountable in $X$.  It follows that the intersection of these neighborhoods, $f^{-1}(\{p\})$, is also co-countable.  But then the image of the connected space $X$ under $f$ is countable and connected, hence a singleton, so that $f$ is constant.
