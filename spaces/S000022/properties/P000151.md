Proved for the one-point Lindel√∂fication of discrete $\omega_1$ as Example 3.24 of {{mr:MR3991109}} and the same proof works, which we sketch here.

For $k \in \omega$, suppose we have $A_j = \{ x_{j,\ell} : \ell \in \omega \}$ for each $j < k$ defined. Consider $F_k = \{ x_{j,\ell} : j < k, \ell \leq k \} \cup \{ \infty \}.$ Given an $\omega$-cover $\mathscr U_k$ of $X$, we can choose $U_k \in \mathscr U_k$ so that $F_k \subseteq U_k$ and, since $U_k$ is a neighborhood of $\infty$, we can define $A_k = \{ x_{k,\ell} : \ell \in \omega \}$ to be so that $U_k = X \setminus A_k$. This defines a strategy for Two in the $\omega$-Rothberger game. To see that it is a winning strategy, consider a run $\{ U_n : n \in \omega \}$ of the game according to the strategy. Consider any finite subset $F$ of $X$. We can let $k\in \omega$ be so that $F \cap \bigcup_{n\in\omega} A_n \subseteq F_k.$ Then $F \subseteq U_k$.
