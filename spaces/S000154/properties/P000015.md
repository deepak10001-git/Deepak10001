Suppose that $f : X \to [0,1]$ is continuous and $f(p) = 0$. For each $n > 0$ the set $U_n = \{ x \in X : 0 \leq f(x) < \frac{1}{n} \}$ is an open neighborhood of $p$, so $X \setminus U_n$ is finite. Then $A = \bigcap_{n > 0} U_n$ is uncountable, and for each $x \in A$ we have $f(x) = 1$.

Therefore there is no continuous function $f : X \to [0,1]$ such that $f^{-1} ( \{ 0 \} ) = \{ p \}$, and $\{ p \}$ is closed.
