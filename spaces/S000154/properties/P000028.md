Given any countable family $\{ U_n : n \in \mathbb{N} \}$ of open neighborhoods of $p$, it follows that $\bigcap_n U_n$ is uncountable. Picking any $x \in \bigcap_n U_n$ distinct from $p$ it follows that $X \setminus \{ x \}$ is an open neighborhood of $p$ which does not have any $U_n$ as a subset.
