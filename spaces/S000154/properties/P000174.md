Given a chain (collection of sets totally ordered by inclusion) $\mathscr C$ of open neighborhoods of the point $p=\infty$, taking complements gives a chain of finite subsets of $X$.  Such a chain is necessarily countable.  Since $X$ is uncountable, there is a point $a\ne p$ that is not in any of the finite sets.  The open set $X\setminus\{a\}$ is a neighborhood of $p$ that does not contain any of the open sets in $\mathscr C$. (See item #5 for space #24 in {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9_6}}.)  This shows that the chain $\mathscr C$ is not a local base at $p$, and $X$ is not {P174}.
