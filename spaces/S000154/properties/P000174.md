Given a chain (collection of sets totally ordered by inclusion) of open neighborhoods of the point $p=\infty$, taking complements gives a chain of finite subsets of $X$.  Such a chain is necessarily countable.  Since $X$ is not {P28} at $p$ (by item #5 for space #19 in {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9_6}}), the original chain of open neighborhoods is not a local base at $p$.  So $X$ is not {P174}.
