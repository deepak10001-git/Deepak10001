Let $\mathcal{B}$ be a base, which we regard as the countable union of families $B_n$. Each singleton of $Y$ is open, and so must appear among the $B_n$. Since $Y$ is uncountable, some $B_k$ contains infinitely-many singletons. Now, any open set containing the point $a$ misses only finitely-many points, so its intersection with $B_k$ is infinite. Therefore, $\mathcal{B}$ is not $\sigma$-locally finite.
