The topology on $X$ is coarser than that of {S158}, so the formal identity map from {S158} to
{S159} restricts to an arc between any two given distinct points in $X$.
More generally, all open sets are of the form $X$ or $(a,1]$ for $0 \leq a \leq 1$, which are all {P38} by
essentially the same argument.
