The reasoning is similar to showing {S36} is {P51}.  Let $A$ be a nonempty subset of $X$.  If $A$ contains an element different from $\omega_1$ and $\omega'_1$, the minimum element of $A$ is isolated in $A$.  Otherwise, $A$ is a subspace of $\{\omega_1,\omega'_1\}$, which has the discrete topology, and every element of $A$ is isolated in $A$.
