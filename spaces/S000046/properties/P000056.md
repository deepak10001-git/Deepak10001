Each interval $U_n=(0,1/n)$ for $n\ge 2$ is open in $X$ and dense since $X$ is {P39}.
So its complement $X\setminus U_n$ is nowhere dense.
The intersection of all the $U_n$ is empty.
Therefore, the union of all the complements is the whole space.
Thus $X$ is a countable union of nowhere dense sets.
