For every point $x$, there are $\mathfrak c$ many points $y$ topologically indistinguishable from $x$. So any path in the space can be turned into an arc.

Now because {S46|P90}, hence is {P42} [(Explore)](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces?q=Alexandrov%2B%7ELocally+path+connected). Finally the results follows from {{mathse:5006475}}.
