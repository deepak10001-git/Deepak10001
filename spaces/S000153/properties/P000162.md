The subspace $X\subseteq Y$ of {S153} given by $X = \{(x, 0) : 0 < x < \omega_1\}$ is a closed copy of $\omega_1$ in $Y$. If $Y$ were realcompact, then its closed subspace $X$ would be realcompact (see theorem 8.10 in {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4615-7819-2}}). But $\omega_1$ is a pseudocompact non-compact Tychonoff space, so is not realcompact, see {T388}.
