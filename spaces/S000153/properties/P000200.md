Let $F : S^1 \to X$ be a continuous map. The image of $F$ is compact and connected, since $S^1$ is. Every compact connected subset of $X$ is either homeomorphic to {S162} or to {S158}, both of which are contractible. Since every continuous map to a contractible space is homotopic to a constant map, it follows that $F$ is in particular.
