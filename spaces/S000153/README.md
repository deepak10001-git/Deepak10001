The space obtained by taking $Y=\omega_1 \times [0,1)$ with its lexicographic order topology ({S38}) and removing the first element $(0,0)$.

The resulting space $X$ is an open subspace of $Y$ with the subspace topology.  This is the same as the order topology on $X$, since $X$ is order-convex in $Y$ (see Theorem 16.4 in {{mr:0464128}}).
