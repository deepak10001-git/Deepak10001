Consider a countably compact subset $A\subseteq X$. It must have finite intersection with the {S17}
subspace $Y$, as otherwise it would contain an infinite closed discrete set. So $A\cap Y$ is closed in $X$.

Since the {S20} subspace $Z$ is closed in $X$, the intersection $A\cap Z$ is closed in $A$, hence countably compact.  Since $Z$ is {P103}, $A\cap Z$ is then closed in $Z$, and therefore closed in $X$.

Then $A$ is closed in $X$ as the union of two closed sets.
