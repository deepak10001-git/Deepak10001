Consider a compact subset. It must have finite intersection with the {S17}
subspace, as otherwise it would contain an infinite closed discrete set. So that piece is closed.

Then its intersection with the {S20} subspace is closed in that subspace, since 
that subspace is {P3}. Since that subspace is closed, the intersection there is closed.

Since the union of two closed sets is closed, the arbitrary compact is closed.
