Consider a sequence with infinite range. If it has infinite intersection in $X$,
then it has a closed subsequence and does not converge. Therefore every
convergent sequence with infinite range contains a tail in $Y$, and thus
converges only to the non-isolated point in $Y$.

Since the space is {P2} (each point may be seen to be closed),
a converging sequence with finite range must converge uniquely to its
constant tail.
