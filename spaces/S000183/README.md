Let $Y$ be {S17} and $Y$ be {S20}. This space is the minimal topology on
the disjoint union $Y\cup Z$ such that $Z$ is closed, and countable
subsets of $Y$ are all closed.

This space was constructed by K.P. Hart in {{mo:452903}} to demonstrate an
example of a space which is {P49} and {P99}, but not {P167}.
