Let $Y$ be {S17} and $Z$ be {S20}. The space $X$ is the disjoint union $Y\cup Z$ with the minimal topology such that $Z$ is a closed subspace of $X$, and countable
subsets of $Y$ are all closed in $X$.

This space was constructed by K.P. Hart in {{mo:452903}} to demonstrate an
example of a space which is {P49} and {P99}, but not {P167}.
