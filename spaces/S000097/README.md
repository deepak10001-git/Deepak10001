Let $X$ be the set of all lattice points $(i,j) \in \omega^2$ together with two extra points $x$ and $y$. Let each $(i,j)$ be open. Basic neighborhoods of $x$ have the form $X \setminus (A\cup\{y\})$ where $A$ is any set of lattice points with at most finitely many points on each row. Basic neighborhoods of $y$ have the form $X \setminus (B\cup\{x\})$ where $B$ is any set of lattice points selected from at most finitely many rows.
