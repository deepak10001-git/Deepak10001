Let $X$ be the set of all prime ideals in $\mathbb{Z}$ with basis consisting of all $V_x = \{P \in X : x \notin P\}$ for all $x \in \mathbb{Z}^+$.

Note that for every $x$, $V_x$ contains all but finitely many $P \in X$ (since each $x$ has finitely many prime factors) and that $0 \in P$ for every $P \in V_x$.

Equivalently, $X$ equals the underlying space of $\mathrm{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})$, the prime spectrum of $\mathbb{Z}$ with the Zariski topology. 

Defined as counterexample #56 ("Prime Ideal Topology") in {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}}.
