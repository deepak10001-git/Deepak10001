$X = \omega \sqcup \{p\}$. A nonempty set is open if and only if it contains $p$ and has a finite complement. This is the closed extension of {S15}. See item #20 for space #12 of {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}}.

$X$ is homeomorphic to the set of all prime ideals in $\mathbb{Z}$ with basis consisting of the sets $V_x = \{P \in X : x \notin P\}$ for all $x \in \mathbb{Z}^+$. The zero ideal identifies with the generic point $p \in X$. This is the Zariski topology on $\mathrm{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})$, the prime spectrum of the ring of integers. See {{wikipedia:Zariski_topology}} for the general construction of the Zariski topology on the prime spectrum of a commutative ring.

Appears as counterexample #56 ("Prime Ideal Topology") in {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}}.
