      name: Is there a first countable, $T_1$, weakly Lindelof, sequentially compact space which is not also compact?

Proof from {{mathse:4874239}}:
take an open cover $\mathcal U$, and choose $\alpha<\omega_1$ where $U_\alpha\subseteq V\in \mathcal U$. 
We note that $\alpha\times [0,1)\cup\{\langle \alpha,0\rangle\}\cong[0,1]$ is compact, so choose 
$\mathcal F\subseteq\mathcal U$ finite covering it. Then $\mathcal F\cup\{V\}$ covers 
$X\setminus(\omega_1 \times \{0\})$, which is dense.
