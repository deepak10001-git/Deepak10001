A point $x \in \mathbb{R}$ is a countable intersection of open sets if, and only if, $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{x\}$ is a countable union of closed sets. Each closed set is finite, and a countable union of finite sets is countable. As, $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{x\}$ is uncountable, then it is not a countable union of closed sets.
