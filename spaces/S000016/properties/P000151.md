Fix a well-order $\preceq_1$ of all nonempty open subsets of $X$ and a well-order $\preceq_2$ of $X$. In round 0, given the open cover $\mathcal{U}_0$ chosen by Player I, Player II chooses $U_0$ to be the minimum element of $\mathcal{U}_0$ under $\preceq_1$. Then, in round $n$ where $n \geq 1$, given the open cover $\mathcal{U}_n$ chosen by Player I, Player II chooses $U_n$ to be the minimum element (under $\preceq_1$) of $\mathcal{U}_n$ that contains the $n$-th (under $\preceq_2$) element of $X \setminus U_0$, if $X \setminus U_0$ has at least $n$ elements. Player II may choose arbitrarily otherwise.

Since $U_0$ is a nonempty open subset of $X$ and thus cofinite, $\{U_n\}_{n < \omega}$ is always an open cover of $X$.
