Let $A \subseteq X$ and $x \in \overline{A}$. If $A$ is finite then $A$ is closed, thus $A = \overline{A}$, so take $x_n := x$ for all $n$. If $A$ is infinite then $\overline{A} = X$ (since $A \subseteq \overline{A}$ thus $\overline{A}$ is closed and infinite, but $X$ is the only closed infinite subset). So take a disjoint sequence $x_n \in A$. Then $x_n$ converges to any point in $X = \overline{A}$ and in particular $x_n \to x$.
