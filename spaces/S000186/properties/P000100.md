Every copy of {S97} in $X$ is closed in $X$ and is also {P100}.
So the intersection of a {P16} set with it is {P16} and hence closed
in it and closed in $X$. If the intersection with infinitely-many
copies is non-empty, then the set must include $\infty$ to be
{P16}, and it follows that the set is closed.
