If $C$ was any compact neighbourhood of $(0,0)$, then there would be a compact set of the form $C_r = \{(x,y): x^2 + y^2 \le r\}$ inside it. But these are all non-compact, as witnessed by the cover $B((0,0), \frac{r}{2})$ together with all sets radii from $(0, 0)$ open, open-ended at $(0,0)$. We cannot omit any set of it, so $X$ is not even locally Lindel√∂f.
