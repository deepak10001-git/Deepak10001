Given $x\in\mathbb R$ and a decreasing sequence of real numbers $a_0>a_1>a_2>\cdots$ converging to $0$, the set of points $\langle x,a_n\rangle$ ($n\in\omega$) is closed in $X$, but also infinite and discrete, hence not compact.  If $p$ is a point on the $x$-axis, every neighborhood of $p$ contains such a set.  So $p$ has no compact neighborhood.
