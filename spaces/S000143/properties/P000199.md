First, suppose $p$ is a point on the $x$-axis and consider a quarter of a circle in $X$ that is tangent to the $x$-axis at the point $p$ and which travels in the counterclockwise direction.  Because "butterfly neighborhoods" of $p$ intersect the quarter-circle in a half-open circular arc containing $p$, it is easy to check that a unit-speed arc starting at $p$ and following the circle counterclockwise will be continuous.

Now choose a fixed radius $R$ and assemble all such circular paths of this radius into a deformation retraction onto the horizontal line $y = R$. Extend this to a deformation retraction onto the upper half plane $y \ge R$ which equals the identity on all points such that $y \ge R$. It follows that $X$ is homotopy equivalent to a contractible space, hence is contractible.
