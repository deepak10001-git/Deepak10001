Consider on the product of the discrete space $\{0,1\}$ and the real line $\mathbb R$ the following equivalence relation
$(k,t)\sim(l,s) \iff (s=t \hbox{ and } t \neq 0) \hbox{ or } (k=l \hbox{ and } s=t=0)$.

The space $X$ is defined as $X:=(\{0,1\}\times \mathbb R)/_\sim$ with the quotient topology.
Geometrically, this is just one real line with a doubled origin.
