Given an infinite set, take a countably-infinite subset. The projection of this set onto
$\sigma\mathbb T^{\omega_1}$ is valued at the identity for all coordinates outside some countable
$C\subseteq\omega_1$. Thus this set is contained within a copy of
the compact space $\mathbb T^{\omega_1}\times(\mathbb T^{C}\times\{e\}^{\omega_1\setminus C})$ for
some countable $C$ and thus has a limit point.
