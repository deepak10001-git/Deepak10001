The example $X=\mathbb T^{\omega_1}\times\Sigma\mathbb T^{\omega_1}$
given on page 5 of <http://www.math.us.edu.pl/sdoktor/ssdnm/Tkachenko-skrypt.pdf>,
where $\mathbb T$ is {S000170}, $T^{\omega_1}$ is its usual product, and
$\Sigma\mathbb T^{\omega_1}=\{x\in\mathbb T^{\omega_1}:|\{\alpha<\omega_1:x(\alpha)\not=e\}|\leq\aleph_0\}$
is its Sigma-product subspace.
