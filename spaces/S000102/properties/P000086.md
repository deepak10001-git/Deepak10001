$X$ is homeorphic to a countable product of discrete spaces of size continuum. Equipped with the discrete topology, the additive reals $\mathbb{R}$ form a discrete topological group $G$ of size continuum. The countable product $G^\omega$ has a topological group structure, which is therefore a homogeneous space. Since $X \approx G^\omega$, it follows that $X$ is homogeneous.
