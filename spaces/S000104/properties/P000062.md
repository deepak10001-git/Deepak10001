The collection $[0,b)\times I^I$, where $b$ ranges over all countable ordinals, is an open covering of the space.  Given any countable subset of this collection, the union of such a subset would be $[0,b)\times I^I$ for some $b<\Omega$.  This set is not dense in $[0,\Omega)\times I^I$.  In particular, the point $(b+1,0)$ has the open neighborhood $(b,b+2)\times I^I$ that missed $[0,b)\times I^I$.
