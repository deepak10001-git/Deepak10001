Take the usual order on $\omega$ together with $\infty$ larger than any $n\in\omega$.  Every element of $\omega$ has an immediate successor and an immediate predecessor (or none), and thus is isolated in the order topology.  And every interval $(n,\infty]$ is cofinite in $X$.  So the topology on $X$ coincides with the order topology.
