By the [Banach-Alaoglu theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach%E2%80%93Alaoglu_theorem), the closed unit ball (with respect to the operator norm) of the continuous dual space $H^*$ is compact in the weak-* topology.  Since the weak-topology on $H$ is homeomorphic to the weak-* topology on $H^*$ by reflexivity of Hilbert spaces, the closed unit ball (with respect to the norm) in $H$ is weakly compact.  If $H$ is a separable Hilbert space, one deduces that the closed unit ball is metrizable in the weak topology; and it is also weakly separable, as it is separable in the stronger (finer) norm-topology.

More generally, every closed ball $B_n$ of radius $n$ about the origin in $H$ is weakly separable and metrizable, hence is second countable and has a countable $k$-network $\mathcal N_n$ for the weak topology.  By the [Uniform boundedness principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_boundedness_principle), every compact subset of $H$ for the weak topology is contained in some ball $B_n$.  So the union of the families $\mathcal N_n$ for $n=1,2,\dots$ is a countable $k$-network for the weak topology on $H$.
