By the Banach-Alaoglu theorem (see Theorem 5.2.1 of
{{doi:10.1007/978-93-86279-42-2}}), the closed unit ball (with respect
to the inner product of $H$) is compact in the weak-* topology, which
on a Hilbert space is equivalent to the weak topology.  Since $H$ is a
topological vector space, the same is true for every closed ball.

Let $K_n$ be the closed ball centered at origin with radius $n$, then $K_n$ is compact and $H = \bigcup_{n \in \omega} K_n$.
Suppose $K$ is any compact subset of $H$, $K$ is pointwise bounded, then $K$ is bounded by [Uniform Boundedness Principle](Uniform_boundedness_principle), thus contained in some $K_n$.
